## Post-Creation Update (2026-01-03)

### Request

Review persona file against updated `skll-create-persona` skill requirements:
1. Header must follow `# Persona: [Role Title]` format
2. Must start with `Impersonate the following persona.` instruction

### Compliance Review

| Requirement | Before | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Header format `# Persona: [Role Title]` | `# AI/LLM Engineer Persona` | Non-compliant |
| `Impersonate the following persona.` | Missing | Non-compliant |

### Fix Applied

Updated `/Users/teazyou/.claude/agents/agt-persona-ai-engineer.md`:
- Changed header from `# AI/LLM Engineer Persona` to `# Persona: AI/LLM Engineer`
- Added `Impersonate the following persona.` instruction after header

### Verification

Persona file now complies with all skill requirements.
