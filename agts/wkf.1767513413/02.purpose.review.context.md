# Skill Review: skll-file-guide

**File:** `/Users/teazyou/sopai/dot-claude/skills/skll-file-guide/SKILL.md`

## Use Case Coverage Analysis

### Use Case 1: Generate entire file map of folder(s)

**Status:** FIXED (was partially covered)

**Original gap:**
- No explicit invocation syntax for standalone folder mapping
- Use case not clearly documented as valid standalone operation

**Fix applied:**
- Added "Full Folder Mapping" use case section
- Added invocation example: `/file-guide ./src ./docs`
- Clarified purpose: sub-agents knowing available files for incoming tasks

### Use Case 2: Generate file map for specific workflow

**Status:** FIXED (was implicitly covered)

**Original gap:**
- Task inference existed but "workflow-specific" mapping not explicit
- No clear invocation pattern

**Fix applied:**
- Added "Workflow-Specific Mapping" use case section
- Added invocation example with task description
- Added "Sub-Agent Context Preparation" as third use case for completeness

### Use Case 3: Output location flexibility

**Status:** FIXED (was missing)

**Original gap:**
- Only mentioned "Generate in cwd"
- No mention of `agts` folder as default
- No instruction for alternative output locations

**Fix applied:**
- Added "Output Location" section with:
  - Default: `./agts/` folder
  - Custom location via `--output` flag
  - In-folder placement examples
- Updated workflow step 4 to reference "specified or default location"

## Changes Summary

| Section | Change Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Use Cases | NEW | Added structured section with 3 explicit use cases |
| Output Location | NEW | Added section documenting default and custom output paths |
| Workflow | MODIFIED | Step 4 now references flexible output location |

## Verification

All three requested use cases are now properly covered:
1. Full folder mapping - explicit with invocation example
2. Workflow-specific mapping - explicit with invocation example
3. Output location flexibility - documented with default (agts) and custom path options
