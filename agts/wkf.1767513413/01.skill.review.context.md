**Generated:** `/Users/teazyou/sopai/dot-claude/skills/skll-file-guide/SKILL.md`

## Fidelity Score: 8/10

## What's Preserved Correctly

### Core Purpose
- Purpose clearly stated: generate `files.agt.md` for agent navigation
- Context window optimization goal retained
- Standalone workflow component context preserved

### Token Efficiency Rules
- First-half reading strategy preserved
- Second-half only if insufficient - correctly captured
- Goal statement ("first half suffices") retained

### Exploration Scope
- 2 parent levels up - preserved
- 2 levels deep exploration - preserved
- Repetitive folder skip pattern - preserved with example

### Output Structure
- Both formats captured:
  - Without request context (file description format)
  - With request context (`[file-guide]` marker format)
- Max 3 header levels constraint - preserved
- Minimal markdown formatting - preserved
- Compact structure focus - preserved

### Folder Structure Visualization
- Example structure included
- Hierarchical notation preserved

### Context Understanding
- Standalone operation mode noted
- Reverse-engineering purpose from files when request unknown - preserved

## What's Missing or Altered

### Missing Elements

1. **Role Definition**
   - Original: "Expert file archivist generating documentation for agentic AI workflows"
   - Skill: Generic skill header, no persona/role framing
   - Impact: Minor - skills don't typically need persona framing

2. **Analysis Instruction**
   - Original: "Review request and each file to understand relationships and usage relative to request/project"
   - Skill: Condensed to workflow step "Determine relationships/usage"
   - Impact: Minor - intent preserved but less explicit

3. **Verbatim Instruction**
   - Original: "Response format (include first paragraph verbatim)" with exact text
   - Skill: Summarized version, not verbatim requirement
   - Impact: Medium - original required exact first paragraph reproduction

4. **Full Example Request**
   - Original: Complete example with `[file-guide]` markers and full response format
   - Skill: Condensed example, missing full response structure
   - Impact: Medium - less guidance for complex cases

### Altered Semantics

1. **Output Path**
   - Original: "Write `./files.agt.md` in current folder"
   - Skill: "Generate `files.agt.md` in cwd"
   - Impact: None - semantically equivalent

2. **Folder Structure Example**
   - Original: More detailed with "MASTER REFERENCE" notation and derivation arrows
   - Skill: Simplified, "MASTER REF" abbreviated
   - Impact: Low - structure concept preserved

3. **Request Parsing**
   - Original: "Identify tasks/sub-tasks requiring file lists OR find `[file-guide]` mentions"
   - Skill: Only `[file-guide]` marker method shown
   - Impact: Low-Medium - OR case (general task identification) less explicit

### Formatting Changes

1. **Constraint Presentation**
   - Original: Bulleted list under "Constraints" heading
   - Skill: Same content, slightly different organization
   - Impact: None

2. **Output Structure Section**
   - Original: Single code block with structure placeholder
   - Skill: Split into two subsections (with/without request)
   - Impact: Positive - clearer organization

| Feature | Original | Skill | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| Role/persona | Expert file archivist | None | Simplified |
| Purpose statement | Detailed | Condensed | OK |
| Token efficiency | Complete | Complete | Match |
| Exploration scope | 2 up, 2 deep | 2 up, 2 deep | Match |
| Skip patterns | Example shown | Example shown | Match |
| Output: no request | Format shown | Format shown | Match |
| Output: with request | Verbatim requirement | Summarized | Altered |
| Folder structure | Full example | Shortened example | Simplified |
| Constraints | 4 items | 4 items | Match |
| Context description | Complete | Complete | Match |
| `[file-guide]` parsing | Full example | Condensed | Simplified |

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority

1. **Restore verbatim first paragraph requirement**
   Add explicit instruction that when request contains `[file-guide]`:
   ```
   First paragraph verbatim:
   "This document is the list of file needed to be use to accomplish this request. Use it to provide agents with only the required files for their task, saving context window and token."
   ```

2. **Expand example request parsing**
   Include full original example showing complete input/output mapping, not just identification of sections.

### Medium Priority

3. **Add general task identification**
   Restore "Identify tasks/sub-tasks requiring file lists" alongside `[file-guide]` marker detection.

4. **Full folder structure example**
   Restore complete example with "MASTER REFERENCE" and derivation relationships for better guidance.

### Low Priority

5. **Consider role framing**
   Could add "Act as expert file archivist" for consistency with agent behavior, though optional for skills.

## Summary

The skill conversion preserves core functionality and constraints effectively. Main losses are:
- Verbatim output requirement (behavior change)
- Full example depth (guidance reduction)
- Dual task identification approach (feature simplification)

The skill is functional and will produce correct outputs for standard cases. Edge case handling (complex multi-`[file-guide]` requests) may be less precise without full examples.

**Verdict:** Production-ready with minor improvements recommended for full parity.
