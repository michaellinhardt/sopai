# Workflow Context

**Initial Request:** Fix CLAUDE.md sub-agent folder creation issue

**Purpose:** Analyze why sub-agents create new agt folders instead of using the orchestrator-provided path, and implement guardrails.

**Method:**
1. Analyze current CLAUDE.md for ambiguity
2. Identify root causes
3. AI Engineer review and correction
4. Apply approved changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sub-agents must only write to provided workflow folder
- Clear distinction between orchestrator and sub-agent behavior
- No ambiguous instructions that trigger folder creation
