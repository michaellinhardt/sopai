# Workflow Context

**Initial Request:** Add file writing rules to CLAUDE.md - agt folder as default, dual-write with .copy for explicit paths

**Purpose:** Ensure files are always tracked in agt folder, with copies when written elsewhere.

**Rules to Implement:**
1. No path specified → write to `./agts/wkf.xxx/`
2. Path specified → write to path AND copy to `./agts/wkf.xxx/` with `.copy.md` suffix

**Method:**
1. Analyze current CLAUDE.md for gaps
2. Identify enforcement mechanisms
3. AI Engineer review and edit
4. Apply approved changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear default behavior (no path = agt folder)
- Dual-write rule for explicit paths
- Naming convention for copies (`.copy.md`)
