# skll-create-skill Structure Fix Log

## Date
2026-01-03

## Problem
The `skll-create-skill` skill was incorrectly created as a single file instead of following the proper folder structure required by Claude Code.

**Incorrect structure:**
```
~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill.md  (single file - WRONG)
```

**Required structure:**
```
~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

## Actions Taken

1. **Read skill guide** at `/Users/teazyou/sopai/skill.guide.md`
   - Confirmed skills must be directories containing a `SKILL.md` file
   - Reviewed proper folder structure requirements

2. **Read existing skill file** at `~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill.md`
   - Content was valid, just in wrong location/format
   - 322 lines of skill instructions

3. **Deleted incorrect file**
   - Removed `~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill.md`

4. **Created proper folder structure**
   - Created directory: `~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill/`
   - Created file: `~/.claude/skills/skll-create-skill/SKILL.md`
   - Preserved all original content

## Result

**Before:**
```
~/.claude/skills/
└── skll-create-skill.md    # Incorrect - single file
```

**After:**
```
~/.claude/skills/
└── skll-create-skill/
    └── SKILL.md            # Correct - folder with SKILL.md
```

## Verification
The skill content remains unchanged. The skill should now be properly recognized by Claude Code when restarted.

## Notes
- No content modifications were made to the skill itself
- Only the file structure was corrected
- Users may need to restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect
