- **Type:** CLI tool (npm global package)
- **Purpose:** Dev Framework For AI Agent
- **Repository:** github.com/michaellinhardt/sopai

## Workflow Tasks

1. **Documentation - Project Overview**
   - Create `docs/project.md` describing the overall project

2. **Documentation - Feature `sopai init`**
   - Create `docs/init/` folder with functional and technical documentation
   - Feature: dynamically link all content from `dot-claude/` to `~/.claude/`
   - Requirements:
     - Dynamic linking (automatically links new folders/files)

   - Test by checking `~/.claude/` content after running command
   - Fix errors until working

## Acceptance Criteria

- `sopai init` command exists and works
- All items in `dot-claude/` are symlinked to `~/.claude/`
- Already linked items are gracefully skipped
- New items added to `dot-claude/` will be linked on next run
- Command tested and verified working

## Files to Link

- `dot-claude/CLAUDE.md` -> `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- (any future files/folders in dot-claude/)

## Status

- [x] docs/project.md created
- [ ] docs/init/ documentation created
- [ ] Implementation complete
