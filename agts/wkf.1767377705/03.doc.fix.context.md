# Documentation Fix Task Context

## Task Summary

Fixed documentation for `sopai init` feature to correctly describe that the command links from the **sopai npm package's own `dot-claude/` folder** (using `__dirname`) to `~/.claude/`, NOT from the current working directory.

## Key Correction

**WRONG (previous docs):** Command looks for `dot-claude/` in `process.cwd()` (current working directory)
**CORRECT:** Command uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'dot-claude')` to find the package's bundled `dot-claude/` folder

## Files Modified

### 1. `/Users/teazyou/sopai/docs/init/README.md`
- Updated overview to clarify command links from sopai package's built-in folder
- Changed purpose from "project-specific" to "standardized/global" setup
- Updated Quick Start to show command works from anywhere
- Updated "How It Works" section to describe locating package's folder
- Updated example to show package installation path as source

### 2. `/Users/teazyou/sopai/docs/init/functional.md`
- Updated prerequisites (no longer requires cwd to have dot-claude/)
- Updated execution flow to describe "Locate Source" from package
- Updated Use Case 1: Changed from "clones a project" to "installs sopai"
- Updated Use Case 2: Changed from "pull changes" to "package update"
- Removed Use Case 4 (Missing dot-claude Folder) - no longer applicable
- Renumbered remaining use cases (5 -> 4, 6 -> 5)
- Removed "No dot-claude folder" from error messages table
- Updated exit codes description
- Updated symlink direction to reference `{sopai-package}/dot-claude/`

### 3. `/Users/teazyou/sopai/docs/init/technical.md`
- Updated algorithm: source path now uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', 'dot-claude')`
- Removed source validation step (step 4) from algorithm
- Updated pseudocode to use `__dirname` instead of `process.cwd()`
- Updated error handling table to remove "Source folder not found" row
- Removed `NO_SOURCE` from error messages
- Updated Init Command code example
- Updated manual test cases: removed "Missing source" case, added "Run from anywhere" case
- Updated complete implementation reference code

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- Documentation now correctly describes that `sopai init` works from any directory
- Source path is accurately described as the package's own `dot-claude/` folder
- Removed all references to "missing dot-claude folder" error case
- All examples and use cases updated to reflect global command behavior
