# BMAD Method Research Report

**Research Date:** 2026-01-19
**Target Audience:** Budget-conscious solo developer with Claude Code subscription

---

## Executive Summary

BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) is a **free, open-source framework** under MIT license created by Brian Madson. It provides a structured multi-agent approach to AI-driven development with excellent Claude Code integration. **No hidden costs** - you only pay for your Claude Code subscription.

---

## Pricing Analysis

### Framework Cost
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| BMAD Framework | **FREE** (MIT License) |
| Premium Tiers | None |
| Enterprise Pricing | None |
| Hidden Infrastructure Costs | None |

### Cost to Run with Claude Code Subscription Only

**Yes, BMAD works entirely within Claude Code subscription** - no API keys required.

| Claude Plan | Monthly Cost | BMAD Compatibility |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Pro | $20/month ($17/yr) | Works - shared limits with web |
| Max $100 | $100/month | Recommended - 5x Pro limits |
| Max $200 | $200/month | Best - 20x Pro limits, full Opus access |

**Important Setup Notes:**
- Run `claude logout` then `claude login` with only subscription credentials
- Remove any `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to avoid API charges
- Use `/status` command to monitor allocation
- Decline API credit prompts when they appear

### Token Consumption Patterns

**Concern:** BMAD operations (creating PRD, architecture docs, stories) do consume more tokens because the system reads multiple files repeatedly.

**Mitigations built into BMAD v6:**
- 70-85% token reduction via "helper pattern"
- Document sharding (large docs broken into focused pieces)
- `/clear` command to reset context between tasks
- `/compact` command to summarize conversations

## Usage Limits

### Framework Limits
| Aspect | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Rate Limits | None from BMAD itself |
| Project Limits | Unlimited |
| Session Limits | None |
| Quotas | None |

### Claude Code Subscription Limits
Your actual limits come from your Claude subscription tier:
- **Pro:** Moderate limits shared between Claude Code and web
- **Max $100:** 5x higher than Pro
- **Max $200:** 20x higher than Pro

## Workflow Capabilities Assessment

### 1. Brainstorming Support
**Rating: Excellent**

BMAD has dedicated brainstorming capabilities through the **Analyst Agent**:
- Three operating modes: creative ideation, market analysis, requirement gathering
- Uses proven techniques: SCAMPER, "What if" scenarios, reverse brainstorming
- Commands: `brainstorm {topic}` for structured sessions
- Transforms vague concepts into well-defined project briefs
- "Advanced Elicitation" feature: 50+ reasoning methods for the LLM to self-critique and improve

**Covers:** Idea to technical/UI decisions through structured ideation workflows

### 2. Documentation Generation
**Rating: Excellent**

Auto-generates comprehensive documentation through specialized agents:

| Agent | Generated Documents |
|-------|-------------------|
| Analyst | Project briefs, research reports |
| PM Agent | PRDs, epics, story breakdowns |
| Architect | Architecture docs, API specs, security docs |
| Scrum Master | Sprint plans, story files |

**Architecture.md output includes:**
- System context and principles
- High-level diagrams and component interactions
- Database design and state management
- API specifications (REST/GraphQL/gRPC)
- Frontend architecture
- Security architecture
- Deployment and CI/CD
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

### 3. Plan Change Propagation
**Rating: Partial (Improving)**

**Current capabilities:**
- Scrum Master agent has `correct-course` workflow for scope changes
- Dependency chains: changes in architecture auto-reference to related docs
- "Agentic memory" maintains project context across agents
- Decision traceability: every choice links to original reasoning

**Limitations:**
- Auto-update for doc-to-code sync is a proposed feature (GitHub Issue #1218)
- Currently requires manual triggering of document updates
- Goal: 70% reduction in manual document-project runs (not yet achieved)
- Known documentation sync issues reported in v6-alpha

**Verdict:** Semi-automatic. Changes propagate through agent context, but full auto-sync is still under development.

### 4. AI-Controlled Development
**Rating: AI-Guided with Human Oversight**

BMAD is designed as **AI-driven but human-controlled**:
- AI agents drive the workflow (not just helpers)
- Human approves at gate checkpoints
- "Docs-as-code" philosophy: documentation is source of truth, code is derivative
- Dev agent executes hyper-detailed story files autonomously
- QA agent provides structured review

**Key distinction:** BMAD structures the chaos of "vibe coding" into repeatable, auditable workflows. AI proposes, human approves, AI executes.

### 5. Full Lifecycle Coverage
**Rating: Excellent**

**Complete coverage from idea to deployment:**

| Phase | Workflows | Commands |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Analysis | Brainstorming, research, product brief | `/brainstorm`, `/research`, `/product-brief` |
| Planning | PRD creation, tech specs | `/prd`, `/tech-spec` |
| Solutioning | Architecture, UX design | `/architecture`, `/solutioning-gate-check` |
| Implementation | Sprint planning, story creation, development | `/sprint-planning`, `/create-story`, `/dev-story` |
| Testing | QA validation, refactoring | QA agent reviews |

**Scale-adaptive:** Automatically adjusts planning depth (Level 0-4) based on project complexity.

## Claude Code Compatibility

### Integration Method

**Native integration via npx or skills:**

**Option 1: Standard Install**
```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

**Option 2: Native Claude Code Skills**
```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/aj-geddes/claude-code-bmad-skills.git
cd claude-code-bmad-skills
chmod +x install-v6.sh
./install-v6.sh
```

### Setup Requirements
1. Install BMAD (one command)
2. Restart Claude Code (skills load on startup)
3. Open project directory
4. Run `/workflow-init` then `/workflow-status`

### Available After Installation
- **9 Specialized Skills:** BMad Master, Business Analyst, Product Manager, System Architect, Scrum Master, Developer, UX Designer, Builder, Creative Intelligence
- **15 Workflow Commands:** Including `/pm`, `/sm`, `/dev`, `/qa` slash commands
- **Cross-platform:** Windows, Linux, macOS, WSL

### Limitations with Claude Code vs Other Tools

| Aspect | Claude Code | Cursor/Windsurf |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Full BMAD support | Yes | Yes |
| Slash commands | Yes | Yes |
| Skills system | Native | Via MCP |
| Token efficiency | Same | Same |

**No significant limitations** - BMAD was designed with Claude Code as primary target.

## Recommendations for Budget-Conscious Solo Developer

### Optimal Setup
1. **Use Claude Max $100/month** - Best value for heavy BMAD usage
2. **Avoid API key setup** - Prevents unexpected charges
3. **Use `/clear` liberally** - Reset context to save tokens
4. **Start with v6** - Better token optimization than v5

### Cost Projection
| Usage Level | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Light (few projects) | $20 (Pro sufficient) |
| Moderate (active development) | $100 (Max recommended) |
| Heavy (multiple concurrent projects) | $200 (Max for Opus access) |

### Workflow Fit Assessment

| Your Need | BMAD Capability | Fit |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Brainstorm idea to tech decisions | Analyst + PM agents | Excellent |
| Auto-generate docs | PRD, architecture, stories | Excellent |
| Plan change propagation | Partial auto, improving | Good |
| AI-driven development | AI proposes, human approves | Excellent |
| Full lifecycle | Idea to deployment | Excellent |
