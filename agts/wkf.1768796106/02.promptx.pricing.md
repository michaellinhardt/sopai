# PromptX by Deepractice - Research Report

**Target Audience:** Budget-conscious solo developer with Claude Code subscription

---

## Summary

PromptX is an **open-source, MIT-licensed** AI Agent Context Platform that enhances AI applications (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) with professional personas, cognitive memory, and tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is **free to use** with no direct costs beyond your existing Claude Code subscription.

---

## Pricing

### Is it Free or Paid?

**FREE** - PromptX is open-source software under the MIT License.

- GitHub Repository: [Deepractice/PromptX](https://github.com/Deepractice/PromptX)
- No subscription fees
- No premium tiers discovered
- No enterprise pricing identified

### Hidden Costs

| Cost Type | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Software License | Free (MIT) |
| API Calls | Uses YOUR Claude Code subscription tokens |
| Infrastructure | Runs locally (desktop client, CLI, or Docker) |
| Cloud Services | None required - self-hosted |

### Cost to Run with Claude Code Subscription

**Zero additional cost** - PromptX acts as an MCP server that enhances Claude Code. You only pay for your existing Claude Code subscription:
- Claude Pro: $20/month
- Claude Max: $100-200/month

Token consumption will increase slightly due to PromptX injecting context (personas, memory, tools) into prompts, but no separate charges apply.

---

## Usage Limits

### Rate Limits or Quotas

**None from PromptX itself** - No rate limits, quotas, or usage restrictions are documented in the PromptX platform. However:

- Your Claude Code subscription limits still apply (e.g., ~45 messages per 5-hour window on Pro)
- PromptX adds context overhead, which may reduce effective message count slightly

### Token Consumption Patterns

PromptX injects additional context into each conversation:
- **Persona definitions** - Professional role instructions
- **Memory retrieval** - Semantic memory from previous sessions
- **Tool schemas** - Available tool definitions

**Estimate:** Each interaction may consume 500-2000 additional tokens for context injection (varies by active persona and memory recall).

### Session/Project Limits

**None discovered** - No session limits or project caps documented.

## Workflow Capabilities Assessment

### 1. Brainstorming Support

| Capability | Rating | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Idea exploration | Partial | Nuwa creates expert personas for domain-specific brainstorming |
| Technical decisions | Partial | Can create "Technical Product Manager" or specialized roles |
| UI decisions | Partial | No specialized UI/UX features; relies on persona quality |

**How it works:** Use Nuwa (role creation engine) to generate domain experts:
- "I need someone who understands both code and product" → Technical Product Manager
- "Create a Python expert who teaches like a patient mentor" → Python Mentor

**Verdict:** Brainstorming support exists through persona creation, but it's NOT a structured brainstorming workflow. You define the expert; the expert advises.

### 2. Documentation Generation

| Feature | Available | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| PRD generation | No | Not a core feature |
| Spec generation | No | Not documented |
| Architecture docs | No | Not documented |
| Content writing | Yes | "Writer" role for authentic content |
| Office documents | Yes | Excel, Word, PDF processing tools |

**Verdict:** PromptX focuses on **content writing** (Writer role with ISSUE methodology), not structured technical documentation. No PRD/spec/architecture generation features found.

### 3. Plan Change Propagation

| Feature | Available |
|---------|-----------|
| Auto-update docs when plan changes | No |
| Linked document synchronization | No |
| Version tracking of plans | No |

**Verdict:** **NOT SUPPORTED** - No evidence of automatic propagation of changes across documents or implementation.

### 4. AI-Controlled Development

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| AI drives development autonomously | No |
| AI as expert advisor | Yes |
| Tool execution capability | Yes (via Luban) |
| Self-directed task completion | Limited |

**How it works:**
- **Luban** connects APIs/databases for AI to execute autonomously
- AI can use tools but requires human direction
- Philosophy: "Treat AI as a person, not software"

**Verdict:** PromptX is a **human-directed assistant**, not an autonomous development driver. AI executes tools but humans define tasks.

### 5. Full Lifecycle Coverage

| Phase | Supported | How |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Idea → | Partial | Nuwa personas for brainstorming |
| Spec → | No | No spec generation |
| Plan → | No | No planning tools |
| Tasks → | No | No task breakdown features |
| Code → | No | No code generation focus |
| Test | No | No testing features |

**Verdict:** **NOT a full lifecycle tool** - PromptX enhances AI conversations with personas and memory, but does NOT provide structured development workflows.

## Claude Code Compatibility

### Integration Method

PromptX integrates via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as an MCP server.

### Setup Requirements

1. **Install via npx** (simplest):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepractice-promptx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-f", "dpml-prompt@snapshot", "mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Optional:** Set `PROMPTX_WORKSPACE` environment variable for custom workspace path

3. **Requirements:**
   - Node.js 18+
   - Runs locally on your machine (macOS, Windows, Linux)

### How It Works with Claude Code

1. PromptX runs as local MCP server (HTTP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:5203/mcp`)
2. Claude Code connects to PromptX via MCP protocol
3. PromptX provides: personas, memory, tools to Claude
4. Claude conversations are enhanced with injected context

### Limitations with Claude Code

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Local only | Must run on same machine as Claude Code |
| Token overhead | Persona/memory injection uses tokens |
| No cloud sync | Memory is local to machine |
| Setup required | Unlike native Claude, requires configuration |

## Key Features Summary

### Three Core Systems

1. **Nuwa** - Role creation engine
   - Natural language → Expert personas
   - 3-5 questions → Complete AI role in 2-3 minutes
   - ISSUE methodology for structured collaboration

2. **Luban** - Tool integration
   - Connect APIs/databases in 3 minutes
   - Secure sandboxed execution
   - AI can use tools autonomously

3. **Writer** - Content creation
   - ISSUE methodology (Inquiry, Understanding, Synthesis, Expression)
   - Authentic, human-like writing
   - Not for technical documentation

### Cognitive Memory System

- Semantic networks (not RAG)
- Spreading activation for recall
- Persistent context across sessions
- Academic paper: "PromptX: A Cognitive Agent Platform with Long-term Memory" (WWW Companion '26)

## Verdict for Budget-Conscious Solo Developer

### Pros
- **Free** (MIT open-source)
- **No additional API costs** beyond Claude subscription
- **Local/private** - data stays on your machine
- **Memory persistence** - maintains context across sessions
- **Persona system** - create specialized experts easily

### Cons
- **NOT a development lifecycle tool** - no spec/plan/task/code workflow
- **No documentation generation** - no PRD, spec, architecture features
- **No plan change propagation** - no auto-updating documents
- **Human-directed** - AI doesn't drive development autonomously
- **Setup overhead** - requires MCP configuration
- **Token overhead** - uses more tokens per interaction

### Recommendation

**PromptX is NOT suitable** if you need:
- Structured brainstorming → spec → plan → tasks → code → test workflow
- Automatic documentation generation (PRDs, specs)
- Plan change propagation to implementation
- AI-driven autonomous development

**PromptX IS suitable** if you want:
- Enhanced AI personas for domain expertise
- Persistent memory across conversations
- Tool/API integration for AI autonomy in execution
- Free enhancement to your Claude Code subscription
