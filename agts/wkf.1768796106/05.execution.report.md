## Key Findings

### Pricing
All three solutions are **FREE** with Claude Code subscription. No API costs.

### Eliminated
**PromptX** - Does NOT meet requirements:
- No documentation generation
- No plan change propagation
- No development workflow
- Not AI-controlled

### Recommendation

**BMAD Method** - Best match for user requirements:
- ✅ AI-driven development (AI proposes, human approves at gates)
- ✅ Excellent brainstorming (Analyst Agent)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Full lifecycle coverage
- ⚠️ Plan change propagation still improving

**Alternative:** Spec Kit if user prefers human-controlled workflow or needs better plan change propagation.

### Upgrade Recommendation
Claude Max $100/month for token headroom during BMAD workflows.
