## Workflow Capabilities Comparison

### 1. Brainstorming Support (Idea → Technical/UI Decisions)

| Framework | Rating | How It Works |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Spec Kit** | ⚠️ Partial | `/speckit.clarify` for structured questions, but NOT open-ended brainstorming from zero |
| **PromptX** | ⚠️ Partial | Nuwa personas for domain experts, but no structured brainstorming workflow |
| **BMAD** | ✅ Excellent | Dedicated Analyst Agent with 3 modes: creative ideation, market analysis, requirement gathering. Uses SCAMPER, "What if" scenarios, reverse brainstorming |

**Winner:** BMAD - Only framework with dedicated brainstorming workflows

### 2. Documentation Generation (PRDs, Specs, Architecture)

| Framework | PRD | Tech Spec | Architecture | Story Files |
|-----------|-----|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Spec Kit** | ✅ Auto | ✅ Auto | ✅ In plans | ✅ Tasks |
| **PromptX** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **BMAD** | ✅ Auto | ✅ Auto | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Hyper-detailed |

**Eliminated:** PromptX - No structured documentation generation

**Winner:** BMAD edges Spec Kit with more comprehensive architecture docs (includes ADRs, API specs, security, deployment)

### 3. Plan Change Propagation (Auto-update when requirements change)

| Framework | Capability | How It Works |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Spec Kit** | ✅ Excellent | "Change PRD → affected plans update automatically", systematic regenerations |
| **PromptX** | ❌ None | No evidence of document synchronization |
| **BMAD** | ⚠️ Partial | `correct-course` workflow exists, dependency tracking, but full auto-sync still in development (Issue #1218) |

**Eliminated:** PromptX - No propagation support

**Winner:** Spec Kit - Core feature vs BMAD's work-in-progress

### 4. AI-Controlled Development

| Framework | Philosophy | Control Model |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Spec Kit** | Human architect + AI implementer | Human-in-the-loop - "You steer, AI codes" |
| **PromptX** | AI as expert advisor | Human-directed assistant - AI executes tools on command |
| **BMAD** | AI-driven with human oversight | AI proposes → human approves → AI executes |

**Analysis:**
- **Spec Kit:** Explicitly NOT autonomous - requires human approval at each phase
- **PromptX:** Human tells AI what to do, AI does it
- **BMAD:** AI drives workflow, human approves at gate checkpoints

**User Need:** "AI-controlled development, user provides design instructions"

**Eliminated:** All three require human involvement, but...
- Spec Kit: Too human-controlled (user must steer each phase)
- PromptX: No development workflow at all
- BMAD: Closest match - AI proposes entire workflows, human approves major gates

**Winner:** BMAD - Most autonomous while maintaining control

### 5. Full Lifecycle Coverage (Idea → Code → Test)

| Framework | Idea | Spec | Plan | Tasks | Code | Test |
|-----------|------|------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Spec Kit** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Integrated |
| **PromptX** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **BMAD** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ QA Agent |

**Eliminated:** PromptX - Not a development lifecycle tool

**Winner:** BMAD - Complete coverage including dedicated brainstorming phase

---

## Final Verdict

### ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: PromptX

**Why:**
- No PRD/spec/architecture generation
- No plan change propagation
- No development workflow
- No lifecycle coverage
- Human-directed only (not AI-driven)

**What it IS good for:** Enhancing Claude Code with personas and memory for general conversations - NOT for structured development workflows.

**Verdict:** Does not meet your requirements.

---

### ⚠️ CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED: Spec Kit

**Pros:**
- Free (MIT)
- Excellent documentation generation
- Best-in-class plan change propagation
- Works natively with Claude Code
- Complete lifecycle coverage

**Cons (CRITICAL for your needs):**
- NOT AI-controlled - explicitly human-in-the-loop
- Limited brainstorming (best when you have initial concept)
- You must steer each phase - "Your role is to steer; AI does the coding"
- Token-heavy (11+ minute sessions reported)

**User Need Analysis:**
- ✅ Documentation generation
- ✅ Plan change propagation
- ❌ **AI-controlled development** - Spec Kit requires human steering at each phase

**Verdict:** Excellent framework, but philosophy conflicts with your desire for AI-controlled development. You'd be the architect manually approving each step.

---

### ✅ RECOMMENDED: BMAD Method

**Pros:**
- Free (MIT)
- Excellent brainstorming (dedicated Analyst Agent)
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- AI-driven workflow (not just AI-assisted)
- Complete lifecycle coverage
- Native Claude Code integration
- 9 specialized agents handle different phases
- 70-85% token reduction in v6

**Cons:**
- Plan change propagation still improving (partial auto-sync)
- More complex setup than Spec Kit
- Higher token consumption than basic coding (mitigated in v6)

**User Need Analysis:**
- ✅ Brainstorming → technical/UI decisions (Analyst Agent)
- ✅ Documentation generation (PRD, architecture, stories)
- ⚠️ Plan change propagation (working, but not as polished as Spec Kit)
- ✅ **AI-controlled development** (AI proposes workflows, human approves gates)
- ✅ Full lifecycle coverage

**Key Differentiator:** BMAD's philosophy aligns with your needs - AI drives the process, you provide design instructions and approve at checkpoints. This is the closest to "AI-controlled development" available.

**Best For Your Use Case:**
- You want AI to propose what to do next, not wait for instructions
- You want structured ideation from vague concepts
- You're okay approving at major gates (not micromanaging each step)
- You value comprehensive architecture documentation
- You can use Claude Max plan for token headroom ($100/month recommended)

```
/architect
Design the system architecture
```

Architect Agent creates:
- System architecture
- Database design
- API specifications
- Security architecture
- Deployment strategy

**Step 4: Sprint Planning**
```
/sm
Create sprint plan
```

Scrum Master Agent:
- Breaks epics into sprints
- Creates hyper-detailed story files
- Sets up development workflow

**Step 5: Development**
```
/dev-story {story-id}
```

Dev Agent:
- Reads story file
- Implements features
- Writes tests
- Updates documentation

**Step 6: Quality Assurance**
```
/qa
Review the implementation
```

QA Agent validates against requirements.

### Cost Management Tips

**Use Claude Max $100/month:**
- 5x higher limits than Pro
- Best value for active development
- Prevents hitting limits mid-workflow

**Token Optimization:**
- Use `/clear` between major tasks to reset context
- Use `/compact` to summarize long conversations
- BMAD v6 has 70-85% token reduction built-in

**Avoid API Charges:**
```bash
# Ensure you're using subscription only
claude logout
claude login  # Use subscription credentials

# Remove API key if set
unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Check status
/status
```

## Alternative: If Plan Change Propagation is Critical

If automatic document synchronization when requirements change is your #1 priority, consider **Spec Kit** despite its human-in-the-loop philosophy:

### Spec Kit Quick Start

```bash
# Install CLI
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Initialize for Claude Code
specify init . --ai claude

# Restart Claude Code to load skills
```

### Spec Kit Workflow

```
/speckit.constitution    # Define project principles
/speckit.specify         # Generate PRD
/speckit.plan           # Create technical plan
/speckit.tasks          # Break down tasks
/speckit.implement      # Code implementation
```

**Tradeoff:** Better change propagation, but you'll be more hands-on steering each phase.

---

## Summary Recommendation

**Primary Choice: BMAD Method**
- Most aligned with your AI-controlled development needs
- Excellent brainstorming and documentation
- Complete lifecycle coverage
- AI drives the workflow
- Free with Claude Code subscription

**Upgrade Your Plan:** Claude Max $100/month recommended for token headroom

**Fallback Choice:** Spec Kit if you discover you prefer more control over each phase, or if BMAD's partial change propagation is insufficient.

**Avoid:** PromptX - excellent for general AI enhancement, but not a development workflow tool.
