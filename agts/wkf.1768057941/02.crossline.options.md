# Temporary/Grey-Area Options for SaaS Payments

> **Context:** French national in Vietnam on tourist visa, no French bank/tax number, needs to receive SaaS subscription payments temporarily while setting up proper legal structure.

---

## Option 1: Personal PayPal Account

**Description:** Use a personal PayPal account linked to your French identity to receive payments. PayPal allows receiving money internationally and can be withdrawn to various bank accounts or used via PayPal debit card.

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Legal Status:** PayPal ToS technically requires business accounts for commercial activity. However, enforcement is inconsistent for small volumes. Tax-wise, you're earning income without declaring it anywhere - this is tax evasion in both France (as a citizen) and Vietnam (as a resident).

**Requirements:**
- Valid French ID/passport
- Email address
- Can link to Vietnamese bank for withdrawals (limited support) or use PayPal balance/card

**Pros:**
- Easy to set up immediately
- Widely trusted by customers
- Can receive from most countries
- No business registration needed upfront
- PayPal debit card allows spending balance directly

**Cons:**
- Account can be frozen if flagged as business activity
- 180-day holds possible on suspicious activity
- Limited withdrawal options without French bank
- Fees: ~3.5% + fixed fee per transaction
- Creates paper trail that could cause issues later

**Duration Viability:** 3-6 months at low volume (<$1000/month). Higher volumes trigger reviews faster.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- What's your expected monthly revenue?
- Do you have any existing PayPal account?
- Are you comfortable with potential account freezes?

### Verification (Community Feedback)

**Real User Experiences:**
- A blogger reported having over $40,000 frozen for 180 days after a product launch. PayPal flags sudden spikes in money received.
- Digital nomads report that logging in from different countries is "almost guaranteed to get your account frozen."
- One SitePoint user had their account closed after 10 years and 10,000+ transactions simply for selling 12 personal items totaling ~$4,000.
- Users describe PayPal as "a notorious source of anxiety for business owners" with accounts frozen without warning.

**Account Closure Statistics:**
- PayPal holds frozen funds for 180 days by law before releasing remaining balance.
- Business accounts cannot be reopened once closed - the policy is permanent.
- Users report that pending transactions at closure get canceled.

**Risk Factors Not Previously Documented:**
- Digital goods (ebooks, software, coaching) are NOT covered under PayPal's Seller Protection - buyers can dispute and funds freeze during investigation.
- PayPal accounts must be registered in your country of residence - using Vietnamese address while French could trigger flags.
- Receiving "an abnormally large amount of money" or customer complaints triggers safeguards.

**Updated Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Community feedback confirms frequent freezes. For digital nomads, risk is elevated due to location inconsistencies. Viable only for very low volumes (<$500/month) and short duration.

## Option 2: Wise (Personal Account)

**Description:** Use Wise personal account to receive payments. Wise provides multi-currency accounts with local bank details in USD, EUR, GBP, etc. Customers pay to your "local" bank details, you convert and withdraw.

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Legal Status:** Similar to PayPal - ToS requires business use to be declared. Wise is stricter about compliance than PayPal. You're operating without proper tax registration.

**Requirements:**
- French passport
- Proof of address (can sometimes use Vietnamese address)
- Smartphone for verification

**Pros:**
- Get local bank details in multiple currencies (US routing number, EU IBAN, etc.)
- Lower fees than PayPal (~0.5-1% conversion)
- Can withdraw to Vietnamese bank account
- Wise card for direct spending
- Professional appearance (customers pay to "bank account")

**Cons:**
- Stricter compliance than PayPal
- Account closure risk if business activity detected
- Need to explain source of funds for larger amounts
- Vietnamese bank withdrawal may have limits

**Duration Viability:** 3-6 months. Wise actively monitors for business patterns.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Can you provide proof of address (any country)?
- What currencies will customers pay in?
- Do you need to invoice customers formally?

---

## Option 3: Cryptocurrency Payments

**Description:** Accept crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC) directly or via processors like BTCPay Server (self-hosted), Coinbase Commerce, or NOWPayments. Convert to fiat via P2P exchanges or keep in crypto.

**Risk Level:** Medium-High

**Legal Status:** Crypto is legally grey in Vietnam (not illegal to hold, but regulated for trading). No tax reporting infrastructure means it's effectively invisible to authorities. France has crypto tax obligations but enforcement requires self-reporting.

**Requirements:**
- Crypto wallet (hardware or software)
- Optional: Payment processor account
- P2P exchange account for fiat conversion (Binance P2P, LocalBitcoins, Remitano)

**Pros:**
- No KYC possible with self-hosted solutions
- Instant global payments
- Can convert to VND via P2P (cash or bank transfer)
- No account freezes (self-custody)
- Lower fees possible (1-2%)
- Works regardless of your legal status

**Cons:**
- Many customers won't pay in crypto
- Volatility risk (mitigated with stablecoins)
- P2P conversion has counterparty risk
- Technical setup required
- May limit your customer base significantly

**Duration Viability:** Indefinitely as pure crypto. P2P fiat conversion sustainable for years at moderate volumes.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Is your target market crypto-friendly?
- Are you comfortable with crypto/wallet management?
- What volume do you expect (P2P has practical limits)?
- Would accepting crypto reduce your conversion rate significantly?

---

## Option 4: Family Member's Business/Bank Account

**Description:** Have a trusted family member (in France or elsewhere) receive payments through their business or personal account, then transfer funds to you.

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Legal Status:** The family member would be receiving business income and is technically liable for taxes on it. If through their business, it's cleaner but still undeclared income. Personal account receipt could be considered as their income or gifts to you.

**Requirements:**
- Trusted family member willing to help
- Their bank account or business account
- Agreement on how funds transfer to you

**Pros:**
- Legitimate-looking payment receipt
- Can use established payment processors
- No setup required on your end
- Family member can issue invoices if they have a business

**Cons:**
- Creates tax liability for family member
- Relationship risk if things go wrong
- Dependent on their cooperation
- Transfer to you still needs explanation
- They could face legal issues if audited

**Duration Viability:** 6-12 months. Sustainable longer if family member declares income properly.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you have a family member with a business?
- What's their risk tolerance?
- How will you compensate them for the hassle/risk?
- Can they handle the accounting burden?

---

## Option 5: "Donations" or "Tips" via Ko-fi/Buy Me a Coffee

**Description:** Frame SaaS payments as voluntary donations or tips through platforms designed for creator support. Customer "donates" the subscription amount regularly.

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium

**Legal Status:** Platforms like Ko-fi have ToS against using donations for product sales. Tax authorities could recharacterize as income. However, enforcement is nearly zero for small amounts.

**Requirements:**
- Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, or similar account
- PayPal or Stripe connection (personal)
- Creative framing of your offering

**Pros:**
- Platforms designed for individuals, not businesses
- Lower scrutiny than payment processors
- Can set up "memberships" that look like donations
- Easy integration
- Customers familiar with the model

**Cons:**
- Doesn't scale well
- Looks unprofessional for B2B SaaS
- Higher fees (~5%+)
- Platform could shut you down
- Awkward customer experience

**Duration Viability:** 3-6 months for validation phase. Not suitable for scaling.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Is your SaaS B2C or B2B?
- What price point are subscriptions?
- Does the "supporter/creator" framing fit your product?

## Option 6: Stripe Atlas (Fast-Track Legal Option)

**Description:** While not grey-area, Stripe Atlas lets you form a US LLC in ~1 week for $500. You get a US business bank account and can receive payments legitimately. You'd still have tax obligations but would have a proper structure.

**Risk Level:** Low (legally) / Medium (tax complexity)

**Legal Status:** Fully legal business structure. However, you'd need to handle US tax filing (simple for single-member LLC) and potentially French tax obligations as a citizen.

**Requirements:**
- $500 for Stripe Atlas
- Passport
- ~1 week setup time

**Pros:**
- Legitimate business structure
- Real US bank account (Mercury/Silicon Valley Bank)
- Access to all payment processors

**Cons:**
- $500 upfront cost
- Annual Delaware franchise tax (~$300)

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you have $500 to invest now?
- Can you handle basic US tax filing?
- Is 1 week too long to wait?

## Option 7: Vietnamese Bank Account (Direct Receipt)

**Description:** Receive international transfers directly to your Vietnamese bank account, disguised as personal transfers from "friends" or "family."

**Risk Level:** High

**Legal Status:** Vietnam has strict foreign exchange controls. Receiving regular business payments without a business license violates regulations. Banks may freeze accounts and report to authorities. Working on a tourist visa is illegal.

**Requirements:**
- Existing Vietnamese bank account
- Cooperative sender (needs to label transfer appropriately)
- Low volume to avoid detection

**Pros:**
- Direct access to VND
- No additional accounts needed
- Simple for customers if they can wire internationally

**Cons:**
- Banks actively monitor for this pattern
- Account freeze risk is real
- Could affect visa renewal if flagged
- International wires are slow and expensive
- Criminal penalties possible (deportation, fines)

**Duration Viability:** Very short-term only (1-3 months). High risk of detection with regular payments.

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- How much do you depend on your Vietnamese bank account?
- Can you afford to have it frozen?
- What's your visa situation's flexibility?

## Option 8: Payoneer Personal Account

**Description:** Payoneer provides virtual US/EU bank accounts. Originally designed for freelancers, it's commonly used by people without proper business setup.

**Description:** If you can quickly form or use an existing entity (friend's company, shelf company), Mercury offers excellent banking for startups with minimal bureaucracy.

**Risk Level:** Medium-High (depending on entity arrangement)
