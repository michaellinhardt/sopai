**Situation:** French citizen, no French bank account or tax number, living in Vietnam on tourist visa (renewed periodically), has Vietnamese bank account (~400M VND), wants to receive subscription payments from SaaS customers.

## Option 1: US LLC via Stripe Atlas

**Description:** Form a US LLC (typically in Delaware or Wyoming) through Stripe Atlas, which bundles company formation with Stripe payment processing and banking. This is a comprehensive solution designed specifically for non-US founders building internet businesses.

**Requirements:**
- Valid passport
- Proof of address (can be foreign)
- No US residency or citizenship required
- No SSN required
- Application takes ~10 minutes

**Costs:**
- Stripe Atlas: $500 one-time fee
- Delaware franchise tax: ~$300/year
- Registered agent: ~$100-200/year
- Banking through Mercury (included in setup)
- Stripe processing fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Pros:**
- End-to-end solution (company, bank, payments)
- Stripe is the gold standard for SaaS payments
- Pre-EIN payments enabled (can start accepting payments immediately)
- Global credibility with a US entity
- No US income tax if income is foreign-sourced and you're not in the US

**Cons:**
- EIN processing for non-residents takes 2-3 months (standard IRS processing)
- Mercury has tightened requirements in 2025; may reject registered agent addresses
- Must file annual US tax returns (5472 form for foreign-owned LLCs)
- Potential complexity with France-US tax treaty implications

**Timeline:** 2-4 months to be fully operational (due to EIN wait time)

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you plan to target US customers primarily?
- Are you comfortable with annual US tax filing requirements?
- Do you have a legitimate business address (not just a registered agent)?

### Verification (January 2025)

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOR NON-RESIDENTS:** Stripe Atlas does NOT support LLC formation for non-US residents. They only support C Corporation formation for international founders. This is a major limitation not clearly disclosed upfront.

**Real User Experiences:**
- Users on Indie Hackers report that "Stripe Atlas can't open a bank account and doesn't offer their payments products to businesses that want to start with their domestic market first" - they require businesses to primarily serve US customers
- Processing limits can be "as low as $100 USD per month" for some countries
- Non-residents from countries without US tax treaty face 30% withholding tax on payments sent outside the US
- Tax complications: Single-member LLCs create complex pass-through tax situations for non-resident aliens

**Mercury Banking Issues (2025):**
- Mercury has significantly tightened requirements in 2025
- **No longer accepts registered agent addresses** - requires physical US business address
- Now requires "US Operations" - accounts without US operations face 60-day restriction then closure
- Many non-residents report sudden account closures with little explanation
- Forum users report: "Mercury is facing a lot of regulations enforcement on them"

**Verified Pricing (2025):**
- Stripe Atlas: $500 one-time (confirmed)
- Delaware franchise tax: $300/year (confirmed)
- Mercury banking: Increasingly difficult to obtain for non-residents

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH for non-residents
- C-Corp only (not LLC) for non-US residents
- Banking increasingly problematic in 2025
- Best suited for founders planning to raise VC funding from US investors

## Option 2: US LLC via Doola or Firstbase

**Description:** Similar to Stripe Atlas but through specialized formation agents. These services help non-US residents form US LLCs with ongoing compliance support, bookkeeping, and tax filing.

**Requirements:**
- Valid passport
- Proof of address
- No SSN/ITIN required initially

**Costs:**
- **Doola:** Starting at $297/year + state fees; registered agent $99/year; comprehensive plans with bookkeeping $500+/year
- **Firstbase:** $399 one-time formation; registered agent $149/year; US address $315/year; tax filing $1,800; bookkeeping from $990/year
- State filing fees: $90 (Delaware) to $200+ (other states)

**Pros:**
- More flexible than Stripe Atlas (can use any payment processor)
- Ongoing compliance support included
- Designed specifically for non-US residents
- Can choose state (Wyoming often better for privacy/costs)

**Cons:**
- Doesn't include payment processing (need to set up separately)
- Banking setup increasingly difficult in 2025
- Higher ongoing costs if using full-service packages

**Timeline:** 3-7 business days for formation; 2-3 months for full banking setup

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you prefer Wyoming (cheaper, more privacy) over Delaware?
- Do you need ongoing bookkeeping and compliance support?
- Are you comfortable setting up payment processing separately?

### Verification (January 2025)

**Real User Experiences:**

**Firstbase Issues:**
- Multiple users report being "2 months in, waiting for an LLC" despite advertised "10 business days"
- One customer: "It will be 2 months since we hired them, and we still can't get our company ready. They told us weeks ago that they lost a piece of paper from Delaware"
- Common complaints: slow turnaround, unresponsive support, confusing dashboards, missed filings
- Unexpected upsells for bookkeeping services
- Refund frustrations tied to partner policies

**Doola Issues:**
- Scored 72/100 in independent reviews - "pricey, and reviews mentioned spotty customer support"
- With Doola, "they don't do the bookkeeping for you. They just provide software" - you take full responsibility
- State fees not included in base pricing
- Some features cost extra

**Banking Access (2025 Reality):**
- Both services promise access to Mercury/Brex, BUT Mercury now requires US Operations and physical US address
- Many non-residents report denial or account closures
- Wise is often the only successful option, but has limited features
- Relay Bank also no longer accepts companies without physical US address

**Verified Pricing (2025):**
- Doola: $297/year base + state fees (~$100-200) + extras
- Firstbase: $399 formation + $149/year registered agent + $315/year US address
- Full-service packages with bookkeeping: $500-2,000/year

**Doola vs Firstbase Verdict:**
- Doola: Better for hands-on customer service, more flexible state options
- Firstbase: Better if you need simpler banking setup (though this advantage has diminished in 2025)

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM
- LLC formation works, but banking is the real challenge in 2025
- Budget 3-4 months for full operational setup
- Have backup banking options ready (Wise, Airwallex)

## Option 3: Estonian e-Residency + Estonian Company (OU)

**Description:** Obtain Estonian e-Residency digital ID and establish an Estonian private limited company (OU). This gives you an EU-based company that can be managed entirely online from anywhere in the world.

**Requirements:**
- Valid passport
- Clean background check (3-8 weeks processing)
- Minimum share capital: EUR 1 (though EUR 1,000-2,500 recommended)
- Designated contact person in Estonia (mandatory)

**Costs:**
- e-Residency application: EUR 150 (valid 5 years)
- Company formation: EUR 200-500
- Contact person/virtual office: EUR 200-400/year
- Bookkeeping services: EUR 50-150/month
- Corporate tax: 0% on retained profits, 24% on distributed profits (2025 rate)

**Pros:**
- Fully digital management from anywhere
- EU company = EU credibility and access
- No tax on retained profits (reinvested earnings)
- Strong ecosystem for digital entrepreneurs
- Can open Wise Business account easily

**Cons:**
- 24% tax when distributing profits (dividends)
- Still need to pay taxes where you're tax resident (Vietnam or France)
- VAT registration required if EU turnover exceeds EUR 40,000
- Requires finding a service provider for contact person

**Timeline:** 2-3 months total (e-Residency: 3-8 weeks; company formation: 1-2 weeks after)

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you plan to reinvest profits in the business rather than taking dividends?
- Do you want to target EU customers specifically?
- Are you comfortable managing Estonian compliance requirements?
- Will your annual turnover likely exceed EUR 40,000?

### Verification (January 2025)

**MAJOR WARNING - VAT ID Changes (August 2025):**
- Starting August 2025, digital nomad companies through e-Residency reportedly NO LONGER receive EU VAT IDs from Estonian authorities
- One entrepreneur (Martin) successfully formed a company through Xolo but was denied a VAT ID
- This is a "huge problem" as it makes Estonian companies potentially "non-viable for digital nomads" invoicing EU customers
- Estonia clarifies: "To receive a VAT identification, the company must be liable to pay VAT in Estonia" - meaning companies with no Estonian economic activity may not qualify

**Tax Increases (2025-2026):**
- Corporate income tax on distributed profits: increased to 24% (from 22%)
- Personal income tax: increased to 22% (from 20%)
- VAT rate: increased to 24% since July 2025
- All rates will increase to 24% by 2026
- e-Residency application fee: increased to EUR 150 (from EUR 100-120)

**Xolo Service Provider Reviews:**
- Trustpilot reviews are mixed
- Positive: "Running my company through Xolo has been smooth, reliable, and genuinely stress-free"
- Negative: "2-5 business day customer support response time is super long"
- Major issue: "Becomes a nightmare when you want to shut down a business. They take ages, charge extras"
- Cryptocurrency businesses NOT supported
- Some users report sudden account termination "without specific explanation"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- e-Residency provides NO physical residency or travel rights to Estonia
- Does NOT provide tax residency benefits without relocating
- You still need to pay taxes where you're actually tax resident (France or Vietnam)
- Setup complexity: "You now have to deal with Estonian bureaucracy AND your home country bureaucracy"

**Real Success Stories:**
- Works well for solopreneurs and consultants in digital space
- Indian entrepreneurs documented successful journey (company formed, LHV bank approved)
- Best for those who plan to reinvest profits rather than take dividends

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH (increased from previous assessment)
- VAT ID changes are significant concern for B2B EU sales
- Tax rates have increased substantially
- Still viable for non-EU focused businesses or those not needing VAT registration

**Timeline:** Same day if in Georgia; 1-2 weeks remotely

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Is the 1% tax rate worth the lack of limited liability?
- Are you willing to establish some presence in Georgia?
- Do you need a "prestigious" jurisdiction for your customers?

### Verification (January 2025)

**MAJOR REGULATORY CHANGE - Work Permits Required (March 2026):**
On June 26, 2025, Georgia passed amendments requiring MANDATORY WORK PERMITS for foreign nationals starting March 1, 2026.

**Key Changes:**
- Two-stage process: First obtain "right to labor/entrepreneurial activity" permit (up to 30 days processing), then apply for D1 visa or work residence permit
- Applies to: employees, self-employed individuals, registered entrepreneurs, AND remote workers for Georgian startups
- Violations incur fines of 2,000 GEL
- "What was once a nearly paperwork-free destination now requires advance planning, government approval, and compliance monitoring"

**Impact on 1% Tax Regime:**
- The 1% tax only applies to income considered to originate from GEORGIA
- Services must be performed within Georgian territory to qualify
- "Otherwise, if you intend to stay here, you will end up paying 20% tax on income, rather than 1%"
- Digital nomads working remotely for foreign clients may NOT qualify for 1% rate

**2025 Tax Regime Updates:**
- 1% rate applies to turnover up to 500,000 GEL (~180,000 USD)
- December 2024 amendments: Construction-related services to Georgian clients NO LONGER eligible for small business regime
- If you exceed threshold for 2 years, status automatically revoked on January 1 of third year

**Important Clarification:**
"Foreign nationals performing labor activity fully remotely without entering Georgian territory or establishing local business registration may not require permits" - but this needs clarification during implementation

**Risk Assessment:** HIGH (previously LOW)
- Regulatory environment has fundamentally changed
- The "digital nomad paradise" reputation is outdated
- From March 2026, Georgia transitions to traditional immigration system
- Consider alternatives if you don't plan to physically reside in Georgia

**Timeline:** Minutes to a few days for verification

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you have a registered business entity already?
- Is your business type supported by Wise?
- Will you primarily receive bank transfers rather than card payments?

### Verification (January 2025)

**CRITICAL WARNING - Account Freezing Epidemic (2025):**
- In 2025, there have been "mass deactivations triggered by AI-driven compliance reviews"
- Automated systems flag accounts using certain keywords, IP patterns, or login behavior
- Capterra rating: 3.8/5 based on 72 reviews - many cite account restrictions or frozen funds "with little explanation"

**Common Triggers for Problems:**
- Keeping large reserves (e.g., GBP 150,000+) can trigger review, restrictions, or closure
- High-risk countries (by passport) face more scrutiny
- Activity patterns and residency status matter
- Some users "don't realize they fall into high-risk categories"

**Wise CEO Statement (January 2025):**
"We only suspend an account when we can't get information about transactions we need to review. As long as you stay in the acceptable use policy, don't get involved in shady and respond to our analysts, then you have nothing to worry about."

**Vietnam Specific:**
- Wise can be used to receive and convert to VND
- Some users use Wise as intermediate: PayPal -> Wise -> Vietnam bank (3-5 days + 1-2 days)
- Better exchange rates than PayPal direct withdrawal

**User Advice:**
- Don't rely on Wise as single banking solution
- Diversify: "Mercury for USD and Airwallex for Euro/GBP"
- Respond promptly to any compliance requests
- Keep transaction documentation ready

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM
- Essential tool for international payments BUT not reliable as sole solution
- Account closure risk is real and documented
- Use as one of multiple banking options

### OPTIONS STATUS AFTER VERIFICATION

| Option | Status | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| US LLC (Stripe Atlas) | CAUTION | MEDIUM-HIGH | LLC not available to non-residents; C-Corp only |
| US LLC (Doola/Firstbase) | VIABLE | MEDIUM | Works but Mercury banking increasingly difficult |

| Paddle/Lemon Squeezy | **RECOMMENDED** | LOW | Best option for your situation |

### TOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FRENCH CITIZEN IN VIETNAM

**IMMEDIATE (Start collecting payments now):**
1. **Lemon Squeezy** - Best Merchant of Record option
   - No company required
   - Handles all VAT/tax compliance
   - Payout via PayPal to Vietnam
   - Acquired by Stripe (stable backing)

**SHORT-TERM (If revenue grows):**
2. **UK Ltd + Wise Business**
   - Fast formation (1-3 days)
   - Wise accepts non-resident directors
   - 25% tax but manageable compliance
   - Avoid Revolut (requires EEA address)

**ALTERNATIVE:**
3. **US LLC via Doola** (Wyoming)
   - Better than Stripe Atlas for non-residents
   - Use Wise for banking (Mercury too strict now)
   - 0% federal tax on foreign-sourced income
   - More paperwork but global credibility

### OPTIONS TO AVOID

1. **Georgia IE** - Regulatory changes have killed the "digital nomad paradise"
2. **Stripe Atlas for LLC** - They only offer C-Corp to non-residents
3. **Estonian e-Residency** - VAT ID problems make it non-viable for EU B2B
4. **Mercury Bank alone** - Too strict now, requires US operations

### CRITICAL BANKING REALITY (2025)

The banking landscape has fundamentally changed in 2024-2025:
- Mercury: Requires US operations and physical US address
- Wise: Account freezing epidemic, AI-driven compliance reviews
- Revolut: Requires EEA/UK address for business accounts
- All banks: Stricter KYC, sudden closures common

**Strategy:** Never rely on a single banking solution. Use multiple providers.

### RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

1. **Week 1:** Sign up for Lemon Squeezy, start accepting payments
2. **Week 2:** Open Payoneer account as payout method
3. **Month 2-3:** If revenue > $1,000/month, consider UK Ltd formation
4. **Month 3+:** Open Wise Business account linked to UK Ltd
5. **Long-term:** Transition to direct Stripe once company established
