## Key Implications

### Critical Finding: VND Payments Change Everything

Since 80%+ of customers are Vietnamese paying in VND:
- **International processors (Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy) are NOT suitable** for main customer base
- **Need Vietnamese payment gateway:** OnePay, VNPay, Momo, ZaloPay, or bank transfer
- **Vietnamese payment gateways require:** Vietnamese company OR partnership with Vietnamese entity

### Options Eliminated
- US LLC via Stripe Atlas - won't help with VND
- Estonian e-Residency - not relevant for VND
- UK Ltd - not relevant for VND
- Singapore company - overkill, won't help VND
- Paddle/Lemon Squeezy - don't support VND

### Options Still Viable

**For Vietnamese Market (80%+ of business):**
1. Vietnam 100% Foreign-Owned LLC
2. Partnership/Agreement with Vietnamese company (temporary)
3. Informal arrangements through Vietnamese contacts (grey-area)
4. Direct bank transfers to Vietnamese bank account (simplest grey-area)

**For International Market (20% of business):**
1. French Micro-Entrepreneur (family can help set up)
2. Personal Wise/PayPal account (grey-area but functional)
