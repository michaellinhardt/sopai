# Final Options Analysis - French SaaS Founder in Vietnam

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Profile:** French citizen, single, living indefinitely in Vietnam on tourist visa
**Business:** AI/Automation SaaS tools
**Capital Available:** ~$16,000 USD (400M VND in Vietnamese bank)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Core Problem:** You need to accept payments from 80%+ Vietnamese customers paying in VND, but standard international solutions (Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy) do not support VND. This fundamentally changes the recommended approach.

**Top 3 Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate (This Week):** Accept VND via direct bank transfer to your existing Vietnamese account + set up Wise for international (20%) customers. Grey-area but functional.

2. **Short-Term (1-3 Months):** Establish French Micro-Entrepreneur with family's help for tax compliance on international revenue. Explore Vietnamese payment gateway partnerships.

3. **Long-Term (6+ Months):** Form 100% Foreign-Owned Vietnamese LLC to access VNPay/OnePay/Momo and establish legal work status via DT4 investor visa.

**Critical Insight:** Most online guides assume international customers paying in USD/EUR. Your situation is inverted - you need LOCAL Vietnamese payment infrastructure, which requires LOCAL Vietnamese business presence.

## Critical Insight: VND Payment Reality

### Why Standard International Solutions Don't Work

**The typical digital nomad/indie hacker advice:**
> "Use Stripe Atlas to form a US LLC, then Paddle or Lemon Squeezy as Merchant of Record."

**Why this fails for your situation:**

| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Stripe | Does not operate in Vietnam; cannot accept VND |
| Paddle | Does not support VND; Vietnamese customers can't pay easily |
| Lemon Squeezy | Same - no VND support |
| PayPal | Limited in Vietnam; many Vietnamese don't have accounts |
| Wise | Receiving only (no payment gateway); not for subscriptions |

**What Vietnamese customers actually use:**
- **Bank transfer** (most common for B2B)
- **VNPay** (integrated into most Vietnamese banking apps)
- **Momo** (largest e-wallet, 31M+ users)
- **ZaloPay** (tied to Zalo messaging app)
- **OnePay** (card processing for Vietnam)

**The catch:** All Vietnamese payment gateways require:
1. Vietnamese business registration (IRC/ERC), OR
2. Partnership with registered Vietnamese entity

**This changes everything.** You cannot simply form a foreign company and collect VND subscriptions through standard international processors.

## Recommended Options (Ranked)

### Tier 1: Immediate Solutions (This Week)

#### Option A: Direct Bank Transfer (Grey-Area)

**What:** Accept VND payments directly to your existing Vietnamese bank account. Customers pay via bank transfer; you provide them account details.

**How it works:**
1. Share your Vietnamese bank account details with customers
2. Customer transfers VND directly
3. You manually verify and activate their subscription
4. Track everything in a spreadsheet for future tax compliance

**Costs:**
- $0 setup
- Bank charges minimal (few thousand VND per transaction)

**Pros:**
- Start immediately (today)
- No new accounts needed
- Zero fees essentially
- Vietnamese customers very familiar with bank transfers
- You already have 400M VND in account (shows activity history)

**Cons:**
- No automated subscription management
- Manual tracking required
- Technically working without permit (existing grey-area you're already in)
- Could trigger bank questions about income source
- No formal invoices without business registration

**Risk Level:** Medium
- This is already how you exist in Vietnam (on tourist visa with bank account)
- Many small foreign businesses operate this way initially
- Risk is same as your current situation, not additional

**Duration:** 3-6 months max before proper structure needed

**Action Steps:**
1. Create simple payment instructions for customers
2. Set up spreadsheet: customer name, payment date, amount, subscription period
3. Keep transaction volume under $3,000/month to avoid bank scrutiny
4. Withdraw to cash regularly (don't accumulate large balance after payments)

---

#### Option B: Set Up Wise Personal Account

**What:** Open Wise account to receive international payments (USD/EUR) from the 20% non-Vietnamese customers.

**Requirements:**
- French passport
- Proof of address (can use Vietnamese address or family's French address)

**Costs:**
- Free to open
- 0.5-1% currency conversion
- No monthly fees

**How it works:**
1. Get USD and EUR bank details from Wise
2. Invoice international customers to these accounts
3. Convert to VND and transfer to Vietnamese bank, OR
4. Keep in Wise and use Wise card for spending

**Pros:**
- Professional appearance (real bank details)
- Multi-currency support
- Lower fees than PayPal
- Wise card works in Vietnam ATMs

**Cons:**
- Not a subscription payment processor
- Manual invoicing required
- Account freezing risk in 2025 (documented issues)
- Personal account - technically business use violates ToS

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium

**Action Steps:**
1. Sign up at wise.com today
2. Complete verification (1-3 days)
3. Get USD and EUR account details
4. Use for international customers only

---

### Tier 2: Short-Term Setup (1-3 Months)

#### Option C: French Micro-Entrepreneur (Auto-Entrepreneur)

**What:** Register as micro-entrepreneur in France using family's address. This gives you a legal business entity for receiving international payments.

**Requirements:**
- French address (family provides)
- No French bank account needed initially
- Register online via URSSAF

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Registration | Free |
| Domiciliation (if using service) | EUR 20-100/month |
| Social charges | ~22% of turnover |
| Revenue ceiling | EUR 77,700/year (~$84,000) |

**Timeline:** Immediate to 2 weeks

**What this enables:**
- Legal business identity in France
- Can open Stripe France account
- Can invoice international customers properly
- Tax compliance in a jurisdiction
- Family can handle French paperwork

**Pros:**
- Cheapest formal structure
- Already familiar French system
- Family can help manage
- Solves international (20%) customer invoicing
- Clear tax situation for that revenue

**Cons:**
- 22% social charges eat into margins
- Still doesn't solve VND payment collection
- Creates French tax obligations
- Need family involvement ongoing
- Not useful for Vietnamese customers (80%)

**Why it's Tier 2:** Only solves 20% of your customer base (international). Still need Vietnamese solution for 80%.

**Action Steps:**
1. Confirm family member willing to receive mail and forward documents
2. Register at autoentrepreneur.urssaf.fr
3. Once registered, apply for Stripe France
4. Use for international customer invoicing only

---

#### Option D: Vietnamese Payment Gateway Partnership (Research Required)

**What:** Partner with existing Vietnamese company to access VNPay/OnePay/Momo integration.

**Potential approaches:**
1. **Revenue share with Vietnamese SaaS company** - They process payments, take %, forward to you
2. **Informal arrangement with Vietnamese contact** - They have company, you use their payment processing
3. **White-label through Vietnamese fintech** - Some offer this to foreign businesses

**This needs research:** The specific options depend on your network and who's willing to partner.

**Costs:** Likely 5-15% revenue share + standard payment processing fees

**Pros:**
- Access to VND payment processing without own company
- Faster than forming own company
- Vietnamese partner handles compliance

**Cons:**
- Dependent on partner relationship
- Less control
- May be informal/grey-area arrangement
- Hard to find reliable partners

**Research Needed:**
- Are there Vietnamese fintech startups offering payment processing partnerships to foreigners?
- What do other foreign SaaS founders in Vietnam actually do?
- Can VNPay/OnePay technically integrate with a foreign company?

**Action Steps:**
1. Ask in Vietnam expat/startup communities (Facebook groups, Slack channels)
2. Contact Vietnamese payment gateways directly to ask requirements
3. Explore connections for potential partnership arrangements

### Tier 3: Long-Term Optimization (6+ Months)

#### Option E: 100% Foreign-Owned Vietnamese LLC (FIE)

**What:** Establish a fully foreign-owned Limited Liability Company in Vietnam. This is the cleanest legal path for operating a business in Vietnam long-term.

**Requirements:**
- Passport (valid 6+ months)
- Investment capital: USD 10,000-20,000 recommended
- Office lease (virtual office minimum USD 1,200/year)
- All documents notarized, legalized at Vietnamese consulate, translated

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Registration services | USD 3,500-5,000 |
| Government fees | USD 60-120 |
| Virtual office | USD 1,200/year |
| Work permit + TRC | USD 1,500 |
| Digital signature | USD 60-100/year |
| Company seal | USD 10-15 |
| Legal/accounting | USD 1,000-2,000 |
| **Total Year 1** | **USD 8,000-12,000** |

**Ongoing costs:** USD 3,000-6,000/year (accounting, compliance, office, renewals)

**Timeline:** 2-4 months (often 4-6 months in practice)

**Tax Implications:**
- Corporate Income Tax: 20% (15% if revenue <3B VND, 17% if 3-50B VND)
- VAT: 8% (temporary reduction through 2026)
- Personal Income Tax: 5-35% progressive on salary

**What this enables:**
- Open corporate bank account in Vietnam
- Access VNPay, OnePay, Momo, ZaloPay integration
- Issue proper VAT invoices to Vietnamese customers
- Work permit exemption as owner/investor
- DT4 visa (1 year) - not great, but legal presence
- Long-term stability and credibility

**Pros:**
- Full legal compliance
- Access to all Vietnamese payment gateways
- Can hire Vietnamese employees
- Build real business asset
- Clear path to permanent residency (if investment reaches DT3 level later)

**Cons:**
- Significant upfront investment (USD 8-12K)
- 2-4 month setup time (can't solve "ASAP" need)
- Ongoing compliance burden
- Office requirement (can't use residential)
- Capital must be contributed within 90 days of ERC
- Corruption/bribery requests reported in registration process

**Verified Reality (January 2026):**
- Process is moderately difficult but well-documented
- 182 foreign-owned startups registered in HCMC (52% of Vietnam total)
- IT/Software/SaaS fully open to 100% foreign ownership
- Bribery requests are common but can be avoided with reputable law firm
- Use a quality law firm, not the cheapest option

**Risk Level:** Low (once established)

**Action Steps:**
1. Research and select reputable Vietnamese law firm
2. Secure virtual office lease
3. Prepare documents (passport, proof of address, financial capacity)
4. Budget USD 12-18K for first year (including contingencies)
5. Plan for 4-6 months timeline

---

#### Option F: French Micro-Entrepreneur + Vietnam LLC (Hybrid)

**The Optimal Long-Term Structure:**

1. **French Micro-Entrepreneur** - For international customers (20%)
   - Simple, low cost
   - Family helps with French side
   - Stripe France for USD/EUR payments

2. **Vietnamese 100% Foreign LLC** - For Vietnamese customers (80%)
   - Access to VNPay/Momo/ZaloPay
   - Legal work status
   - VND payment processing

**Why this works:**
- Each structure optimized for its market
- Clear separation of revenue streams
- Tax compliance in both jurisdictions
- Scalable as business grows

**Combined Costs:**
- French side: ~22% social charges on international revenue
- Vietnam side: ~20% CIT on Vietnamese revenue + setup costs
- Total setup: USD 8,000-12,000 (Vietnam is the expensive part)

| **Vietnam Branch Office** | Requires 5+ year old foreign company you don't have |
| **Vietnam BCC (Business Cooperation Contract)** | Unlimited liability; requires trusted Vietnamese partner you don't have |

| **Vietnam SEZ Company** | Overkill for early-stage; tax benefits only matter when profitable |

   - Any risk of account closure as unemployed foreigner?

### Lower Priority Research

5. **Crypto Payments**
   - Would accepting USDT/USDC work for Vietnamese tech customers?

## Final Recommendations Summary

### If You Need to Start TODAY:

1. Accept VND via bank transfer
2. Open Wise for international customers
3. Track everything for future compliance
4. Research Vietnamese payment gateway options

### If You Have 1-3 Months:

1. Continue bank transfer + Wise
2. Set up French Micro-Entrepreneur with family
3. Actively pursue Vietnamese payment gateway partnerships
4. Evaluate revenue to decide on Vietnam LLC

### If You're Building for Long-Term:

1. Dual structure: French ME + Vietnam LLC
2. VNPay/Momo integration for Vietnamese customers
3. Stripe France for international customers
4. Legal work status via DT4 visa (upgrade to DT3 when possible)

**Bottom Line:** Your situation is unique because of the 80% Vietnamese/VND customer base. Most online advice doesn't apply. You need Vietnamese business infrastructure, not just an international payment processor. The grey-area approach works short-term, but budget for proper Vietnam LLC setup within 6 months if revenue grows as expected.
