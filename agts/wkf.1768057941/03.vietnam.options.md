**Timeline:** 2-4 months for full registration

**Tax Implications:**

- VAT: 10% (8% temporary reduction through 2026 for most services)
- Personal Income Tax: 5-35% progressive for residents

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: MODERATELY DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE**

**Bureaucratic Challenges:**
- TMF Group's Global Business Complexity Index 2024 ranks Vietnam 49th globally (down from 42nd in 2022, showing improvement)
- Process takes 2-4 months minimum; many report 4-6 months for full setup
- Two-step licensing (IRC then ERC) cannot run concurrently - adds time
- All documents require Vietnamese translation, notarization, and legalization at Vietnamese consulate abroad
- Local DoLISA offices interpret guidelines differently - inconsistent experiences

**Corruption Reports:**
- Multiple sources confirm bribery requests are common: "Anyone opening any business anywhere in Vietnam will most probably have to pay a bribe" (Quora testimonial)
- One Canadian foreigner reported a USD 5,000 bribe demand just to register a business
- Despite reforms, corruption remains widespread per TMF Group 2024 report

**Capital Verification Issues:**
- Capital must be contributed within 90 days of ERC issuance - strict deadline
- Banks may scrutinize source of funds
- Insufficient capital leads to registration rejection

**Office Address Requirement:**
- Cannot use residential apartment - verified as strict requirement
- Virtual office minimum USD 1,200/year in major cities
- Lease must be signed BEFORE registration begins

**Positive Developments (2024-2025):**
- Decree 31/2023 reduced IRC/ERC processing to 10 days in some cases
- Process reduced from 7 procedures to 2 procedures
- IT/Software/SaaS fully open to 100% foreign ownership
- No minimum capital requirement for software (but USD 10-15K recommended)

**Real Expat Experiences:**
- American entrepreneur Aric Austin (former Yahoo exec) successfully registered in Vietnam - cited "Opportunity" as main reason
- Trade Horizons founder (US) became permanent resident and opened company in 2023
- Foreign-owned startups in HCMC grew to 182 as of 2024 (52% of Vietnam's total)

**Recommendation for French SaaS Founder:**
This is the cleanest legal path but requires patience and budget. Use a reputable local law firm (not the cheapest). Budget 4-6 months and USD 12-18K all-in for first year including contingencies.

## Option 2: Investment Visa (DT Visa) Without Full Company

**Description:** Obtain an investor visa by contributing capital to a Vietnamese company (existing or new) without necessarily running the full company yourself. Different tiers based on investment amount.

**Legal Structure:** Investment in Vietnamese entity (as shareholder/investor)

**Requirements:**
- **DT1 Visa:** Investment >= VND 100 billion (~USD 4.3 million) - TRC up to 10 years
- **DT2 Visa:** Investment VND 50-100 billion (~USD 2.15-4.3 million) - TRC up to 5 years
- **DT3 Visa:** Investment VND 3-50 billion (~USD 130,000-2.15 million) - TRC up to 2 years
- **DT4 Visa:** Investment < VND 3 billion (~USD 130,000) - Up to 1 year, NO TRC
- **Documents:** IRC, ERC of the invested company, proof of capital contribution
- **Capital:** Must be transferred to company's investment account in Vietnam

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Minimum investment (DT4) | < USD 130,000 |
| Minimum investment (DT3) | USD 130,000+ |
| Visa processing | USD 200-500 |
| Legal fees | USD 1,000-3,000 |

**Timeline:** 1-2 months after company registration

**Tax Implications:**
- Same as owning company if you're the investor
- Dividends taxed at 5% PIT
- No separate taxation for holding visa

**Pros:**
- Work permit exemption for investors
- DT3+ provides Temporary Residence Card (long-term stay)
- Legal status for conducting business activities
- Can be combined with company ownership

**Cons:**
- DT4 (your likely tier with ~USD 16,000) does NOT qualify for TRC
- DT4 only provides 1-year visa maximum
- Requires actual capital contribution to company
- Must prove investment through bank statements

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- How much capital can you invest (USD 16,000 vs USD 130,000+)?
- Is long-term residency (2+ years) important to you?
- Are you willing to tie up capital in the company?
- Would you rather have visa stability or more flexible capital?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: LIMITED PRACTICAL VALUE FOR SMALL INVESTORS**

**DT4 Limitations (Your Tier with ~USD 16,000):**
- DT4 does NOT qualify for Temporary Residence Card (TRC) - confirmed across multiple sources
- Maximum 1-year visa with DT4 - must renew annually
- Cannot sponsor family members (spouse/children) for TT dependent visas
- Essentially same visa hassle as tourist visa approach, but with capital locked up

**DT3 Reality (USD 130,000+ threshold):**
- VND 3 billion (~USD 130,000) is the minimum for TRC eligibility
- TRC validity up to 2-3 years depending on investment amount
- Can sponsor family members
- Work permit exemption confirmed for company owners/capital contributors

**2025 Golden Visa Developments:**
- May 2025: Vietnam launched new "Golden Visa" program with 10-year residency options
- July 2025: Nationality Law amendments exempt significant investors from language requirements and 5-year residency mandates
- Presidential approval pathway introduced for limited dual citizenship for major investors

**Work Permit Exemption Verified:**
- Article 154 of 2019 Labor Code confirms: owners, capital contributors of LLCs, and board members of JSCs are exempt from work permit
- You must still prove your investor status with proper documentation

**Practical Assessment:**
- With only USD 16,000, DT4 visa provides minimal advantage over tourist visa
- You'd tie up capital for 1-year visa that doesn't solve long-term residency
- Better to either (a) go full 100% LLC route for same visa tier, or (b) save for DT3 threshold

**NOT RECOMMENDED for user's current capital level (~USD 16,000)**

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: NOT SUITABLE FOR SAAS BUSINESS**

**Critical Limitation Confirmed:**
- RO CANNOT conduct any commercial/revenue-generating activities - verified across all sources
- Cannot sign contracts, issue invoices, or collect payments
- For SaaS business, this is a non-starter

**When RO Makes Sense:**
- Market research before full company setup
- Liaison/coordination for parent company
- Brand promotion activities only

**Requirement Verified:**
- Parent company must be 1+ year old AND have remaining validity of 1+ year
- You would need to first establish a foreign company elsewhere (France, Estonia, etc.)

**NOT APPLICABLE - User needs to receive SaaS payments**

---

- VAT registration required

**Pros:**
- Can sign contracts and generate revenue

- Not a separate legal entity (simplified governance)

**Cons:**
- Requires foreign parent company (5+ years old)

- More complex than RO
- Still requires foreign entity first

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you have a foreign company that has been operating for 5+ years?
- Is your business activity permitted for branches under Vietnam's commitments?
- Do you want the branch to be profit-generating in Vietnam?
- Are you comfortable with the parent company being liable for branch activities?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: NOT APPLICABLE FOR USER'S SITUATION**

**Key Requirement Barrier:**
- Parent company must be legally established for 5+ years
- User does not have an existing 5-year-old foreign company

**If User Had Qualifying Parent Company:**
- Branch can conduct business and generate revenue (unlike RO)
- Faster setup than full LLC (2-4 weeks)
- But parent company remains liable for all branch obligations

**NOT APPLICABLE - User lacks 5+ year foreign company requirement**

---

## Option 5: Business Cooperation Contract (BCC)

**Description:** A contractual arrangement between a foreign investor and a Vietnamese investor to jointly carry out business activities WITHOUT creating a new legal entity.

**Legal Structure:** Contractual arrangement (no new entity)

**Requirements:**
- Vietnamese partner (individual or company)
- Investment Registration Certificate (IRC) required
- BCC contract outlining:
  - Profit/loss sharing

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: HIGH RISK - REQUIRES EXCEPTIONAL TRUST**

**Community Feedback on Vietnamese Partnerships:**
- Unlimited liability for both parties is a major deterrent
- Disputes are complicated without centralized management structure
- Better suited for project-based work, not ongoing SaaS business

**Trust Factor:**
- Finding a trustworthy Vietnamese partner is the critical challenge
- Cultural business differences reported by foreign entrepreneurs
- Vietnamese employees/partners may be reserved with foreigners initially

**When BCC Works:**
- Joint projects with clear end dates
- Accessing restricted sectors (not needed for SaaS)
- When you have a very well-established, trusted relationship

**NOT RECOMMENDED unless user has an extremely trusted Vietnamese business partner**

---

## Option 6: Joint Venture with Vietnamese Partner

**Description:** Establish a new legal entity (typically LLC) with a Vietnamese individual or company as co-investor. Required for certain restricted sectors.

**Legal Structure:** Joint Venture LLC

**Requirements:**
- Vietnamese partner (individual or company)
- Same registration process as foreign LLC (IRC + ERC)
- Joint venture agreement defining:
  - Ownership percentages
  - Capital contributions
  - Management structure
  - Profit distribution
  - Exit provisions
- Foreign ownership may be capped in certain sectors

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Registration (same as LLC) | USD 3,500-5,000 |
| JV agreement drafting | USD 2,000-5,000 |
| Legal due diligence | USD 1,000-3,000 |
| Office and other costs | USD 5,000-10,000 |
| **Total first year** | **USD 12,000-25,000** |

**Timeline:** 2-4 months

**Tax Implications:**
- Same as 100% foreign LLC
- CIT 20% on profits
- Dividends to foreign shareholder taxed at 5%
- PIT for foreign manager/director

**Pros:**
- Access to restricted sectors
- Local partner brings market knowledge
- Shared costs and risks
- Vietnamese partner can be your spouse (if applicable)
- Legitimate legal structure

**Cons:**
- Requires finding trustworthy partner
- Shared control and decision-making
- Potential for disputes
- More complex than solo ownership
- Partner may have different objectives
- Exit can be complicated

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you have a Vietnamese partner you trust with business decisions?
- Is your business in a sector requiring local partnership?
- Are you comfortable sharing control and profits?
- Do you have a Vietnamese spouse who could be a partner?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: VIABLE IF YOU HAVE VIETNAMESE SPOUSE**

**Spouse as JV Partner - Common Practice:**
- Many expats use Vietnamese spouse as JV partner
- Simpler than 100% foreign LLC (no IRC required if spouse holds majority)
- Can structure as 51% spouse / 49% foreigner to avoid foreign investment registration
- Or register as FIE joint venture for full legal protection

**Trust Considerations:**
- Relationship stability is critical factor
- Shared control means both parties have legal standing
- Cleaner than pure nominee arrangement (see Option 7)

**Software/SaaS Sector:**
- 100% foreign ownership IS allowed for software
- JV only necessary if you WANT local partner involvement
- No sector restriction forcing partnership

**Recommendation:**
- If married to Vietnamese citizen: consider 51/49 local company structure (faster, cheaper)
- Alternative: proper FIE JV with full investor protections
- Ensure proper shareholder agreements regardless of structure

**POTENTIALLY VIABLE if married to Vietnamese citizen with stable relationship**

---

## Option 7: Using Vietnamese Spouse/Partner (Nominee Arrangement)

**Description:** Having a Vietnamese spouse or partner register the business in their name while you operate it. This is a common but legally risky approach.

**Legal Structure:** Vietnamese-owned LLC (on paper)

**Requirements:**
- Vietnamese spouse or trusted partner
- Standard Vietnamese company registration (simpler than FIE)
- Internal agreements (declaration of trust, power of attorney)
- No IRC required (domestic company)

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Company registration | VND 5-10 million (~USD 200-400) |
| Legal agreements | USD 1,000-2,000 |
| Office (virtual) | USD 500-1,000/year |
| **Total first year** | **USD 2,000-4,000** |

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**Tax Implications:**
- Standard Vietnamese company taxation
- CIT 20% (15-17% for smaller revenues)
- PIT for owner/employees
- VAT 10%

**Pros:**
- Fastest and cheapest option
- Simpler registration (no IRC)
- Full business capabilities
- No foreign ownership restrictions
- Lower ongoing compliance costs
- Spouse has genuine Vietnamese ID

**Cons:**
- **HIGH LEGAL RISK:** You have no legal ownership
- Spouse is the legal owner (controls bank accounts, profits, decisions)
- In disputes, you have NO legal protection
- Could be considered "sham transaction" under Investment Law
- Investment may be terminated if discovered
- Dependent on relationship stability
- Cannot build business value you legally own

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Are you married to a Vietnamese citizen?
- How is your relationship stability?
- Do you fully trust your spouse with business control?
- Are you comfortable with having zero legal ownership?
- Is this a small-scale operation where risk is acceptable?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: COMMON BUT LEGALLY PRECARIOUS**

**What Community Reports:**
- This arrangement is VERY common among expats in Vietnam
- Many small business owners operate this way for years
- Fastest and cheapest setup option (1-2 weeks, USD 2-4K)

**Legal Reality - CRITICAL RISKS:**
- You have ZERO legal ownership - your spouse owns everything
- Bank accounts, contracts, assets - all in spouse's name
- In case of divorce or dispute, you have NO legal recourse
- Government may view as "sham transaction" under Investment Law
- If discovered, investment could be terminated

**When People Use It Anyway:**
- Small-scale businesses with low capital at risk
- Very stable long-term marriages
- As temporary solution before proper registration
- When bureaucratic hurdles seem insurmountable

**French Expat Consideration:**
- French-Vietnamese community is large in Vietnam
- Many mixed marriages use this structure
- BUT: consider what happens to your SaaS business if relationship ends

**Risk Assessment:**
- Low risk: Small lifestyle business, minimal capital
- HIGH RISK: SaaS with growth potential, investor interest, significant revenue

**DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE to recommend - high personal risk despite common usage**

## Option 8: Nominee Director/Shareholder Arrangement (Without Spouse)

**Description:** Using a Vietnamese individual (not spouse) as a nominee to hold shares or serve as director on your behalf through private agreements.

**Legal Structure:** Appears as Vietnamese-owned company

**Requirements:**
- Nominee service provider or trusted individual
- Declaration of Trust agreement
- Power of Attorney
- Deed of Indemnity
- Private loan agreements (to document capital)

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Nominee shareholder fee | USD 3,000-5,000/year |
| Nominee director fee | USD 5,000/year |
| Legal documentation | USD 2,000-5,000 |
| Company registration | USD 500-1,000 |
| **Total first year** | **USD 10,000-15,000** |

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Tax Implications:**
- Same as Vietnamese company
- Nominee must declare income appropriately
- Complex tax structuring needed

**Pros:**
- Faster setup than FIE
- Access to restricted sectors
- Privacy for beneficial owner
- No foreign investment registration

**Cons:**
- **LEGALLY GREY AREA**
- No explicit legal protection
- Government may view as "sham transaction"
- Nominee can assert legal ownership
- Subject to Anti-Money Laundering scrutiny
- Significant trust required
- Ongoing nominee fees
- Difficult to exit or sell business

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Is your business in a restricted sector requiring this arrangement?
- Do you have access to trustworthy nominee service providers?
- Are you comfortable operating in a legal grey area?
- Is the business small enough that the risks are acceptable?
- Do you have legal counsel experienced in these arrangements?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: LEGALLY GREY - NOT RECOMMENDED**

**How Nominee Arrangements Work in Practice:**
- Nominee shareholder holds company on paper; beneficial owner controls via private agreements
- Declaration of Trust, Power of Attorney, and Deed of Indemnity documents used
- Call & put option arrangements allow eventual "buyout" of nominee shares
- Some law firms/consultancies offer these services

**Legal Status - PROBLEMATIC:**
- Vietnam Investment Law does not explicitly recognize nominee structures
- May be considered "sham transaction" - investment could be invalidated
- Anti-Money Laundering scrutiny applies
- Nominee can legally assert ownership despite private agreements
- No explicit legal protection if nominee betrays agreement

**Cost Reality:**
- Annual nominee fees: USD 3,000-5,000/year (ongoing cost)
- Legal documentation: USD 2,000-5,000 upfront
- Total first year: USD 10,000-15,000 (comparable to proper FIE!)

**Community Consensus:**
- "Nominee arrangements in Vietnam can be safe... provided they conduct thorough due diligence and engage reputable consultants"
- BUT: "prevalence of unqualified agents in the market" is acknowledged risk
- Trust is critical - you're giving someone legal control of your business

**Why It's Used:**
- Access to restricted sectors (NOT needed for SaaS - 100% foreign allowed)
- Privacy for beneficial owner
- Avoiding foreign investment registration complexity

**For SaaS Business:**
- Since software is 100% open to foreign ownership, NO NEED for nominee
- Cost is similar to proper 100% LLC - why take the legal risk?
- Exit/sale of business becomes complicated with nominee structure

**NOT RECOMMENDED - unnecessary legal risk when proper alternatives exist**

## Option 9: Employer of Record (EOR) / PEO Services

**Description:** Use a third-party EOR company to legally "employ" you in Vietnam while you work for your own foreign SaaS business. The EOR handles all local compliance.

**Legal Structure:** Employment contract with EOR (not your own company)

**Requirements:**
- EOR provider with Vietnam presence (Deel, Remote, Acclime, etc.)
- Your foreign SaaS company (to pay the EOR)
- Work permit and visa through EOR
- Service agreement with EOR

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| EOR monthly fee | USD 179-599/employee/month |
| Work permit processing | Included or USD 1,000-1,500 additional |
| **Annual cost** | **USD 2,200-7,200/year** |

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to onboard

**Tax Implications:**
- EOR handles all Vietnam employment taxes
- PIT deducted from your "salary"
- Social insurance contributions
- Your foreign company pays EOR invoices (deductible business expense)

**Pros:**
- Legal presence in Vietnam immediately
- Work permit and visa handled
- No company registration required
- Compliant with Vietnamese labor law
- Can focus on business, not admin
- Easy to scale up/down

**Cons:**
- You're technically an employee, not business owner
- SaaS payments still go to foreign company
- Doesn't solve receiving SaaS payments IN Vietnam
- Ongoing monthly costs
- Less control than owning company
- Not suitable for building Vietnamese business

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you already have a foreign company that can engage the EOR?
- Is your main goal legal residency rather than receiving payments in Vietnam?
- Are you okay with being an "employee" rather than business owner?
- Is the monthly EOR cost acceptable for the convenience?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: GOOD FOR VISA/RESIDENCY - NOT FOR SAAS PAYMENTS**

**Major EOR Providers in Vietnam:**
- **Deel:** USD 599/month per employee, USD 49/month per contractor
- **Remote:** USD 699/month (USD 599/month with annual payment)
- Both have direct legal entities in Vietnam (no third-party reliance)

**What EOR Actually Provides:**
- Work permit sponsorship and processing
- Temporary Residence Card support
- Compliant payroll in VND
- Social insurance contributions (21.5% employer side)
- Tax withholding and filing
- Employment contracts per Vietnamese law

**Key Limitation for SaaS Founder:**
- You are an EMPLOYEE, not a business owner
- Your SaaS payments still go to foreign company (Stripe, etc.)
- EOR does NOT solve "receiving payments in Vietnam" problem
- You'd need foreign company to engage the EOR and pay invoices

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Annual cost: USD 2,200-7,200 (depending on provider/plan)
- Gets you: legal work permit + TRC (long-term residency)
- Doesn't get you: ability to invoice Vietnamese clients, local business presence

**When EOR Makes Sense:**
- You have/will establish foreign company for SaaS (Estonia, France, Singapore)
- Primary goal is legal residency in Vietnam
- You want to be fully tax-compliant in Vietnam
- You don't need Vietnamese business bank account

**User Feedback on Providers:**
- Deel: praised for intuitive dashboard, fast onboarding; some find pricing steep
- Remote: easy to start, but mixed reviews on support response times
- Both handle Vietnam work permit processing

**French SaaS Founder Consideration:**
- If you keep French auto-entrepreneur or establish Estonian e-Residency company
- EOR gives you legal presence in Vietnam as "employee" of your foreign company
- SaaS revenue flows through foreign company; you pay yourself salary through EOR

**VIABLE OPTION for visa/residency if combined with foreign company structure**

## Option 10: Digital Nomad / Tourist Visa Approach (Current Status)

**Description:** Continue operating on tourist visa with payments received through foreign company or international payment processors, while being physically present in Vietnam.

**Legal Structure:** None in Vietnam (foreign company or sole proprietor abroad)

**Requirements:**
- Valid passport
- 90-day e-visa (renewable with exit)
- Foreign company or sole proprietorship in another jurisdiction
- International payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, Wise, etc.)

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| E-visa (90 days, multiple entry) | USD 25-50 |
| Border runs (every 90 days) | USD 100-300/trip |
| Foreign company maintenance | Varies by jurisdiction |
| **Annual visa costs** | **USD 400-1,500** |

**Timeline:** Immediate (current status)

**Tax Implications:**
- Vietnam: May be considered tax resident if staying 183+ days
- Home country (France): Likely still tax resident
- Double taxation treaty may apply
- Technically working illegally if no work permit

**Pros:**
- No upfront investment
- Maximum flexibility
- Can change plans easily
- Low immediate cost
- Keep options open

**Cons:**
- **LEGALLY GREY AREA** (working without permit)
- Cannot open business bank account in Vietnam
- Cannot receive payments in Vietnam legally
- Tax residence confusion (France vs Vietnam)
- No long-term stability
- Risk of deportation if caught working
- Limited banking options after leaving employment

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Are you comfortable with ongoing visa runs?
- Do you have a foreign company/jurisdiction for your SaaS?
- What is your tax residence situation with France?
- Is this a short-term solution while you evaluate options?
- Can you receive payments through foreign channels (Stripe, Wise)?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: COMMON PRACTICE BUT LEGALLY RISKY**

**Current Visa Situation (2024-2025):**
- 90-day e-visa available for all nationalities (since August 2023)
- Single or multiple entry options
- E-visa fee: USD 25 (single) or USD 50 (multiple entry)
- France has 45-day visa exemption (extended through March 2028)

**Border Run Reality:**
- Border runs still work and are "stress-free" per recent reports
- Popular crossing points: Moc Bai (70km from HCMC to Cambodia), Lao Bao (Quang Tri to Laos)
- Cost per border run: USD 100-300 depending on method
- Can do every 90 days with new e-visa

**Digital Nomad Visa Status:**
- Vietnam does NOT have a digital nomad visa as of 2025
- Golden Visa proposal (April 2025) under consideration but not implemented
- Thailand and Malaysia have digital nomad visas; Vietnam is behind

**Legal Grey Area - REALITY:**
- Working on tourist visa is technically illegal (no work permit)
- Risk of deportation if caught working
- "Do not declare intention to work remotely" when applying - per visa guides
- Enforcement is rare but risk exists

**Tax Implications - CRITICAL:**
- If you stay 183+ days in Vietnam: potential Vietnamese tax residency
- France-Vietnam double taxation treaty exists but complex
- Could trigger tax obligations in BOTH countries
- Need professional tax advice urgently

**Banking After Employment:**
- User has Vietnamese bank account with 400M VND
- After leaving employment, bank may request proof of income source
- Some banks close accounts of unemployed foreigners
- Transferring VND abroad has restrictions

**Why Digital Nomads Still Do It:**
- Vietnam ranked most affordable country for expats 4 consecutive years (InterNations 2024)
- Cost of living 59% lower than US
- Excellent internet (47th globally for fixed speeds)
- Vibrant expat community

**For French SaaS Founder:**
- This is your CURRENT status - not a new option
- Works short-term but doesn't solve:
  - Legal work status
  - Tax residency clarity
  - Business banking for SaaS
  - Long-term stability

**VIABLE SHORT-TERM but unsustainable for growing SaaS business**

## Option 11: Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Company

**Description:** Establish company in one of Vietnam's Special Economic Zones or Industrial Parks to benefit from tax incentives and streamlined procedures.

**Legal Structure:** FIE LLC within designated zone

**Requirements:**
- Same as regular FIE
- Location within approved SEZ/Industrial Park
- May have sector-specific requirements
- Notable zones: Hoa Lac High-Tech Zone (Hanoi), Tan Thuan EPZ (HCMC), Dung Quat EZ

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Standard FIE registration | USD 5,000-8,000 |
| Zone-specific fees | Varies |
| Office/space in zone | Often subsidized |
| **Total first year** | **USD 8,000-20,000** |

**Timeline:** 2-4 months

**Tax Implications:**
- **CIT exemption:** Up to 4 years
- **CIT reduction:** 50% for up to 9 subsequent years
- Preferential CIT rate: 10% for up to 30 years (high-tech)
- Import duty exemptions on equipment
- Land rent incentives

**Pros:**
- Significant tax benefits
- Streamlined administrative procedures
- Infrastructure support
- Access to skilled workforce
- Government support services
- Credibility with investors

**Cons:**
- Must operate from designated zone
- May require manufacturing/R&D focus
- Not all zones suitable for SaaS
- Geographic restrictions
- Compliance with zone regulations
- May be overkill for small SaaS

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Is your SaaS technology-focused (software development, AI, etc.)?
- Are you willing to locate in a specific zone?
- Do you expect significant revenue that would benefit from tax incentives?
- Are you planning substantial R&D activities?
- Is a 10+ year commitment to Vietnam realistic for you?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: OVERKILL FOR EARLY-STAGE SAAS**

**Tax Benefits Are Real But Require Scale:**
- CIT exemption up to 4 years (but you need profits first)
- 50% CIT reduction for up to 9 subsequent years
- 10% preferential CIT rate for up to 30 years (high-tech)
- Import duty exemptions on equipment

**Practical Barriers:**
- Must physically operate from designated zone
- Geographic restriction may not suit lifestyle
- Zones designed for manufacturing, R&D, larger operations
- Administrative overhead for zone compliance

**Zones Mentioned:**
- Hoa Lac High-Tech Zone (Hanoi)
- Tan Thuan EPZ (HCMC)
- Dung Quat Economic Zone

**When SEZ Makes Sense:**
- You're building a tech company with significant R&D
- You expect revenue > USD 500K/year in Vietnam
- You plan to hire Vietnamese developers/staff
- Long-term (10+ year) Vietnam commitment

**For Early-Stage SaaS Founder:**
- Tax benefits don't matter if you have no profits yet
- Location restriction adds complexity
- Standard 100% LLC is simpler for starting out
- Can always restructure later when at scale

**NOT RECOMMENDED for early-stage SaaS - consider later when scaling**

## Option 12: Acquire Existing Vietnamese Company

**Description:** Purchase shares in an existing Vietnamese company that already has the necessary licenses and registrations.

**Legal Structure:** Acquired LLC (FIE or Joint Venture)

- Transfer of management

**Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|

| Legal due diligence | USD 2,000-5,000 |
| Purchase price | Varies (often USD 5,000-20,000 for shell) |
| Registration updates | USD 1,000-2,000 |
| **Total** | **USD 10,000-30,000+** |

**Timeline:** 1-2 months

**Tax Implications:**

- May have existing tax liabilities
- Capital gains tax for seller

- May include useful licenses

**Cons:**

### Questions to Determine Suitability
- Do you want to skip the new registration process?
- Are you comfortable with due diligence risks?
- Is there a specific type of license you need?
- Do you have budget for acquisition plus legal fees?
- Can you find a suitable target company?

### Verification (Community Feedback - January 2026)

**Reality Check: RISKY AND RARELY WORTH IT**

**Hidden Liability Risk:**
- Previous tax obligations may transfer to you
- Unknown contractual obligations
- Reputation issues from previous owner
- Due diligence is expensive (USD 2,000-5,000 just for legal review)

**When Acquisition Works:**
- Company has specific licenses you need (not required for SaaS)
- Company has valuable existing contracts/customers
- Time is critical and 2-4 months for new registration is unacceptable
- Seller is motivated and transparent

**Cost Reality:**
- Shell companies: USD 5,000-20,000 purchase price
- Plus due diligence: USD 2,000-5,000
- Plus registration updates: USD 1,000-2,000
- Total: USD 10,000-30,000+ (often MORE than new registration)

**For SaaS Business:**
- No specific license required for software
- No advantage in acquiring existing company
- Higher risk, similar or higher cost
- New registration gives clean slate

**NOT RECOMMENDED - new registration is cleaner and often cheaper**

- Branch if need to invoice Vietnamese clients

### Scenario D: Have Trusted Vietnamese Partner
**Best Options:** BCC or Joint Venture
- BCC for flexibility without new entity

## Key Action Items for User

1. **Clarify Tax Residence:** Determine your tax status with France (still French tax resident?)

2. **Secure Foreign Banking:** Establish banking outside Vietnam (Wise Business, Revolut Business, or home country)

3. **Evaluate Capital:** Determine how much you can invest (affects DT visa tier)

4. **Decide Timeline:** Short-term flexibility vs long-term stability

5. **Check Relationship Status:** If married to Vietnamese citizen, joint venture becomes attractive

6. **Consult Local Lawyer:** For any formal registration, engage Vietnam-based legal counsel
