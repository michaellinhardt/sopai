# Workflow Context

## Request
Research BMAD production usage, find top 5 alternatives, deep-dive each alternative, synthesize final report.

## Purpose
Comprehensive landscape analysis of full-lifecycle AI workflow frameworks.

## Method
1. Phase 1 (parallel):
   - 01: Search BMAD production usage
   - 02: Find top 5 alternatives to BMAD
2. Phase 2 (parallel, depends on 02):
   - 03-07: Deep-dive each alternative
3. Phase 3:
   - 08: Final synthesis report

## Acceptance Criteria
