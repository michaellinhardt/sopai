# BMAD Production Usage Research

## Executive Summary

**Finding: No verified evidence of enterprise production adoption was found.**

After thorough online research, I could not find any publicly documented cases of established companies or enterprises using BMAD (Brian Madison's AI workflow framework) in production environments. While BMAD has significant community traction (1.8K+ GitHub stars, hundreds of thousands of users claimed), the evidence points to primarily individual developers and hobbyists using the framework, not named production companies.

## Key Findings

### 1. No Named Production Companies Found

Despite extensive searching, I found:
- **Zero** publicly named companies stating they use BMAD in production
- **Zero** verified enterprise case studies with company names
- **Zero** client testimonials from identifiable businesses
- **Zero** production apps with traceable company ownership

### 2. Organizations With BMAD-Related Activity

#### AI Singapore
- Created **BMAD AI/ML Engineering Expansion Pack** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aisingapore/bmad-aisg-aiml))
- Used for their programs: MVP, POC, SIP, LADP
- Includes specialized ML agents for deployment and monitoring
- **Status**: Appears to be an internal training/development framework, not necessarily production customer-facing apps

#### GMO Internet Group (Japan)
- Published blog posts about BMAD Method ([GMO Blog](https://recruit.group.gmo/engineer/jisedai/blog/the-bmad-method-a-framework-for-spec-oriented-ai-driven-development/))
- Content is educational/exploratory in nature
- **Status**: No evidence of actual production deployment; appears to be research/evaluation content

#### Kanzen
- Hosts BMAD documentation on kanzen.sh ([Kanzen Lifecycles](https://www.kanzen.sh/lifecycles/bmadcode/bmad-method))
- **Status**: Documentation hosting only, not a production user

#### BMad Code, LLC
- Creator Brian Madison's company
- Holds trademarks for BMad and BMAD-METHOD
- **Status**: Framework creator, not an example of third-party adoption

### 3. Individual Success Claims (Unverified)

Several Medium articles and blog posts claim success:

- **Steve Kaplan AI** claims to have built "a complete SaaS application architecture in 4 hours" - an AI testimonial content creator ([Medium](https://stevekaplanai.medium.com/the-bmad-method-how-i-build-ai-apps-10x-faster-than-traditional-dev-teams-23fddf0ff56e))
  - However, this is a personal project, not a production company deployment

- **BMadCodes.com Showcase** lists project types built with BMAD ([Showcase](https://bmadcodes.com/ai-agent-showcase/)):
  - Content automation tools
  - AI wellness assistants
  - Educational AI tools
  - SaaS product planning tools
  - **All described generically without company names**

### 4. Criticism and Skepticism

Multiple sources express skepticism about production viability:

- Critics note "a lot of videos that cover [BMAD] also just show how it's used in a dummy app" rather than actual production-grade applications
- Some suggest BMAD methods "are used to cover for a lack of coding experience"
- The framework is explicitly noted as being **V6 Alpha** - "stable enough for testing but not production-ready yet"
- V4 is described as "production-ready" for the framework itself, but this refers to the framework's stability, not evidence of production deployments

### 5. Community and Adoption Metrics

**What the numbers show:**
- 1.8K+ GitHub stars
- "Hundreds of thousands" of users claimed worldwide
- V4 Masterclass has 120K views
- Active Discord community

**What the numbers don't show:**
- Named enterprise customers
- Production deployment case studies
- Revenue-generating applications in production

## Enterprise-Readiness Claims vs. Evidence

### Claims Made
BMAD marketing materials claim:
- "Enterprise-ready features"
- "Governance and Compliance" capabilities
- Support for "large, globally distributed teams"
- SOC 2/HIPAA compliance support

### Evidence Found
- These features exist in the framework design
- Microsoft/Accenture studies cited are about **general structured AI approaches**, not BMAD specifically
- GitHub productivity studies cited are also about **general AI tools**, not BMAD-specific results

## Production Readiness Assessment

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Framework stability | V4 stable, V6 in alpha |
| Named production users | None found |
| Case studies | None with verifiable companies |
| Enterprise deployments | No evidence |
| Individual projects | Many claims, few verifiable |
| Revenue-generating apps | No evidence |

## Conclusion

BMAD appears to be a well-designed, actively developed framework with genuine community interest, but **there is no verifiable evidence of production company adoption**. The usage appears concentrated among:

1. Individual developers experimenting with AI-assisted development
2. Hobbyists and learners
3. Content creators (YouTubers, bloggers) demonstrating the framework
4. Potential early-stage adoption by AI Singapore for internal programs

The absence of named company testimonials, despite the framework's community size, suggests either:
- Companies using BMAD are not publicly disclosing it
- Production adoption is still nascent/experimental
- The framework is primarily used for learning/prototyping rather than production systems
