# Top 5 Alternatives to BMAD: Full-Lifecycle AI Workflow Frameworks

1. **GitHub Spec Kit** - GitHub's open-source toolkit for spec-driven development that provides a four-phase gated process (Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement) for AI coding agents like Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI, focusing on feature-level spec-to-code generation with a constitution and technical plans as single source of truth.

2. **MetaGPT** (60k+ GitHub stars) - Multi-agent framework simulating a complete software company with specialized roles (Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, QA Engineer) that takes a one-line requirement and outputs PRDs, designs, tasks, and code through assembly-line collaboration.

3. **AutoGPT** (181k+ GitHub stars) - Pioneering autonomous agent platform that independently pursues goals through iterative planning, execution, and self-reflection, with persistent memory, visual workflow building, and a marketplace of pre-built agents for continuous operation.

4. **CrewAI** (42k+ GitHub stars) - Lightweight Python framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents with defined roles, goals, and tools, supporting sequential, hierarchical, and consensus-based collaboration processes for complex multi-agent automation.

5. **PromptX** (3k GitHub stars) - MCP-native framework featuring continuous dialogue with specialized AI personas through Nuwa (persona creation) and Luban (API tool integration), positioned for interoperable agent ecosystems.

**Note:** BMAD focuses on full project lifecycle management with 12+ specialized agents and strict human-in-the-loop governance, while Spec Kit focuses on feature-level development with developer-as-orchestrator, and MetaGPT/AutoGPT/CrewAI provide more flexible multi-agent automation without the same level of structured phase gates.
