## Claim

Ralph operates on four core artifacts: `idea.md`, `specs` directory, `plan.md`, and `loop.sh` execution.

## Verdict

**PARTIALLY TRUE**

## Analysis

### What the Evidence Shows

The claim correctly identifies some Ralph artifacts but uses non-standard naming and omits important components.

**Accurate Elements:**

| Claimed | Actual Equivalent | Status |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `specs` directory | `specs/` directory | VERIFIED |
| `loop.sh` execution | `ralph.sh` or `loop.sh` | VERIFIED |
| `plan.md` | `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` or `prd.json` | PARTIALLY CORRECT |
| `idea.md` | Not found in any documentation | UNVERIFIED |

**Detailed Findings:**

1. **`specs/` Directory** - VERIFIED
   - Multiple sources confirm Ralph uses a `specs/` directory containing requirements organized by JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) topics
   - ClaytonFarr's playbook explicitly shows: `specs/` with `[topic-a].md`, `[topic-b].md`
   - Geoff Huntley states specs are "formed through a conversation with the agent at the beginning phase of a project"

2. **Loop Script** - VERIFIED (different naming)
   - Official snarktank/ralph repository uses `ralph.sh`
   - ClaytonFarr playbook uses `loop.sh`
   - Both serve as the bash orchestration script that spawns fresh AI instances
   - The loop is fundamental to Ralph's operation

3. **Plan File** - PARTIALLY CORRECT (different naming)
   - ClaytonFarr playbook uses `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - snarktank/ralph uses `prd.json` (Product Requirements Document in JSON format)
   - frankbria/ralph-claude-code uses `@fix_plan.md`
   - No standard `plan.md` naming found, though the concept of a plan/task file is central

4. **`idea.md`** - NOT FOUND
   - No mention of `idea.md` in any official documentation, GitHub repositories, or technical articles
   - The ideation phase exists conceptually (conversation with LLM before specs) but is not persisted to a standard `idea.md` file
   - Some implementations use `prompt.md`, `PROMPT.md`, or `PROMPT_plan.md` for instructions, but not `idea.md`

### Actual Core Artifacts by Implementation

**snarktank/ralph (Official):**
- `ralph.sh` - Loop orchestration
- `prompt.md` - Agent instructions
- `prd.json` - Task list with status
- `progress.txt` - Learnings persistence

**ClaytonFarr ralph-playbook:**
- `loop.sh` - Orchestration script
- `PROMPT_plan.md` - Planning mode instructions
- `PROMPT_build.md` - Building mode instructions
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Task list
- `specs/` - Requirements directory
- `AGENTS.md` - Operational learnings

**frankbria/ralph-claude-code:**
- `@fix_plan.md` - Prioritized task list
- `@AGENT.md` - Build/test instructions
- `PROMPT.md` - Development instructions
- `specs/` - Requirements

### Conclusion

The claim contains two verified artifacts (specs directory, loop execution), one partially correct artifact (plan file exists but with different naming), and one unverified artifact (idea.md). The "four core artifacts" framing oversimplifies Ralph's actual architecture, which varies by implementation and typically includes 4-6 key files plus supporting infrastructure. The `idea.md` file appears to be either a misremembering, a variant implementation, or conflation with the ideation conversation phase that precedes spec creation.
