# Fact Check: Overnight To-Do App Build with Ralph

## Claim

The author successfully built a fully functional to-do list application overnight using Ralph by running the loop while sleeping.

## Verdict

**PARTIALLY TRUE**

## Analysis

### What Is Verified

1. **Ralph exists and supports overnight autonomous coding**: Ralph is a well-documented autonomous AI agent loop created by Geoffrey Huntley in May 2025. It is designed specifically to run AI coding agents (like Claude Code/Amp) in continuous loops while developers are away, including overnight.

2. **Todo apps are a canonical Ralph example**: Multiple sources use "build a todo API" as the standard example for demonstrating proper Ralph prompt structure. The documentation explicitly shows how to specify todo app requirements with clear exit criteria.

3. **Overnight builds are a documented use case**: Multiple credible sources confirm that Ralph enables overnight autonomous development:
   - YC hackathon teams shipped 6+ repositories overnight for ~$297 in API costs
   - One developer migrated integration tests to unit tests while sleeping
   - A legacy React application was upgraded from v16 to v19 over a 14-hour autonomous session

4. **The technique works by running loops while sleeping**: This is the core design philosophy of Ralph - persistent iteration where the agent commits progress, and developers return to completed work.

### What Cannot Be Verified

1. **This specific author's personal claim**: No corroborating evidence was found for the specific claim that "the author" built a todo app overnight. This appears to be a personal anecdote that matches the documented capabilities of Ralph but cannot be independently verified.

2. **"Fully functional" outcome**: While Ralph can build applications, documentation notes that "for every overnight win, there are loops that burned through iterations without converging." Success is not guaranteed and depends heavily on prompt precision and exit criteria specification.

### Assessment

The claim is **plausible and consistent with documented Ralph capabilities**. Building a todo app overnight using Ralph while sleeping is exactly the type of use case Ralph was designed for, and todo apps are frequently cited as example projects. However:

- This is presented as a personal claim with no external verification
- The documentation explicitly uses todo apps as hypothetical examples, not as completed case studies
- Sources acknowledge these overnight successes are "cherry-picked" and not typical outcomes

The claim accurately describes what Ralph is capable of doing, but the specific personal success story cannot be verified through public sources.
