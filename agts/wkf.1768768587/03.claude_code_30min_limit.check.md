## Verdict
**EXAGGERATED / MISLEADING**

## Analysis

### What the Evidence Shows

**No 30-minute mandatory intervention limit exists.** After extensive searching of official Anthropic documentation, GitHub repositories, and technical articles, there is no evidence of a hard-coded 30-minute limit requiring human intervention for Claude Code's autonomous operation.

### The Origin of "30 Minutes"

The only reference to "30 minutes" found relates to **performance benchmarks**, not operational limits:

> "Claude Opus 4.5 delivers measurable gains where it matters most: stronger results on our hardest evaluations and consistent performance through 30-minute autonomous coding sessions."

This describes a **benchmark duration for testing**, not a maximum operational limit.

### Actual Constraints and Recommendations

1. **No Time-Based Intervention Requirement**: Claude Code has no built-in timer that forces human check-ins at fixed intervals.

2. **Permission-Based Control**: Human intervention occurs through the permission system:
   - Default Mode: Prompts for approval before sensitive operations
   - Auto-accept Mode: Automatically approves file edits
   - Plan Mode: Read-only analysis, no modifications

3. **Recommended Supervision**: Anthropic's best practices recommend human-in-the-loop for code review, test execution, and approvals, but this is **guidance, not enforcement**. The recommendation states approximately "10-30% of total task time" for supervision, which is context-dependent.

4. **Proven Extended Autonomous Operation**:
   - The ralph-wiggum plugin enables "hours without manual intervention"
   - Independent experiments have demonstrated 24+ hour autonomous runs
   - Subagents and background tasks enable parallel, long-running workflows

5. **Actual Limits That Exist**:
   - **5-hour rolling usage windows** (API rate limits, not intervention requirements)
   - **Bash command timeout**: 2 minutes by default (configurable up to hours)
   - **Max iterations**: Configurable via `--max-iterations` flag (safety net for token usage, not time-based)
   - **Max turns in non-interactive mode**: Configurable iteration limits

### Conclusion

The claim conflates performance benchmarks with operational requirements. While Anthropic recommends human oversight and provides multiple mechanisms for control (permissions, checkpoints, hooks), there is **no enforced 30-minute intervention limit**. Claude Code can operate autonomously for extended periods when configured appropriately (using `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--allowedTools`, or proper permission configurations).

The claim may stem from:
1. Misinterpreting the 30-minute benchmark reference
2. Confusing default permission prompts with time-based requirements
3. Misunderstanding rate limits (5-hour windows) as intervention requirements

Users seeking extended autonomous operation should use the ralph-wiggum plugin, configure appropriate permissions, and set iteration/token limits as safety nets rather than expecting time-based forced interruptions.
