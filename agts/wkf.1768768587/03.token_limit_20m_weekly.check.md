## Verdict

**UNVERIFIABLE / POTENTIALLY FALSE**

## Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Anthropic Does NOT Publish Exact Token Numbers for Weekly Limits**
   - Official documentation describes limits in terms of messages per session, hours of usage, and relative multipliers (5x, 20x) - NOT specific token counts.
   - The official help articles state limits depend on "the length of your messages, file attachments, conversation length, and model/feature used."

2. **What Anthropic Actually Documents**
   - **Pro Plan ($20/month):** ~45 messages every 5 hours; 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly
   - **Max 5x ($100/month):** ~225 messages every 5 hours; 140-280 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly; 15-35 hours of Opus 4
   - **Max 20x ($200/month):** ~900 messages every 5 hours; 240-480 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly; 24-40 hours of Opus 4

3. **API Rate Limits (Different System)**
   - API rate limits are measured in tokens per MINUTE, not per week
   - Tier 4 API limits: 2,000,000 input tokens per minute, 400,000 output tokens per minute
   - These are throughput limits, not usage caps

4. **No "20 Million Tokens" Reference Found**
   - Extensive searches across official Anthropic documentation, help centers, and third-party analysis found NO mention of a "20 million tokens per week" limit.
   - The specific number "20 million" does not appear in any authoritative source related to Claude usage limits.

5. **Weekly Limits Were Introduced August 2025**
   - Anthropic introduced two weekly rate limits (effective August 28, 2025): one for overall usage and one specifically for Opus 4.
   - These operate alongside the existing 5-hour rolling session limits.

### Conclusion

The claim of a "20 million tokens per week" limit cannot be verified from any official Anthropic source. Anthropic deliberately avoids publishing specific token thresholds for consumer plans, instead using time-based estimates and relative usage descriptions. The number may be:

- A rough estimate/calculation by a user or third party
- A misunderstanding of API per-minute limits extrapolated to weekly figures
- An outdated or plan-specific number not publicly documented
- Entirely fabricated

Without an official Anthropic source confirming this specific figure, the claim should be treated as unverified.
