## Verdict
**FALSE**

## Analysis

### Actual Numbers on SEEK
The claim that 20% of jobs on SEEK are data entry specialists for AI training is demonstrably false based on multiple data points:

1. **AI jobs are 0.17% of SEEK postings**: An analysis compiled by economist Matt Cowgill and Assistant Minister Andrew Leigh using SEEK data found that AI jobs made up only 0.17% of all advertised positions in Australia - that is 1 in every 588 advertised roles. This is approximately 118 times smaller than the claimed 20%.

2. **Current SEEK job counts contradict the claim**:
   - Total jobs on SEEK: Approximately 100,000+ active listings
   - AI Training jobs: 384 listings
   - Data Annotation jobs: 4 listings
   - Artificial Intelligence jobs (all types): 1,214 listings
   - Data Entry jobs: 3,921 listings (these are traditional data entry roles, not AI training)

3. **Percentage calculations**: Even if we combined all AI-related jobs (AI + Data Annotation + AI Training), they would represent approximately 1-2% of total listings at most - nowhere near 20%.

### Contextual Analysis
- The data labeling and AI training market is growing rapidly (23.6% CAGR projected through 2030), but from a small base.
- Much AI data annotation work is done through specialized platforms (DataAnnotation.tech, Appen, LXT) rather than traditional job boards like SEEK.
- Traditional "data entry" roles on SEEK are clerical/administrative positions, not AI training roles.

### Origin of Claim
No credible source for the 20% claim was found. It appears to be either a fabrication or a significant misinterpretation of job market data. The claim overstates the actual proportion by approximately **100x**.

### Conclusion
The claim conflates two different job categories (traditional data entry vs. AI training data annotation) and vastly overstates the proportion of AI-related jobs on SEEK. The actual percentage of AI-related jobs on SEEK is approximately 0.17%, not 20%.
