## Verdict
**PARTIALLY TRUE**

## Analysis

### What the Evidence Supports

The claim that Ralph enables extended autonomous coding sessions is broadly supported by multiple sources, though the specific "8-12 hour" figure is not a precise technical specification but rather a reasonable approximation of documented use cases.

**Documented Session Durations:**
- **6-hour session**: HumanLayer blog documents a refactoring task that ran for 6 hours autonomously
- **14-hour session**: Multiple sources cite a community member (ynkzlk) who ran a 14-hour autonomous session upgrading React from v16 to v19
- **Overnight sessions**: Y Combinator hackathon teams shipped 6+ repositories overnight using Ralph
- **3-month cumulative**: Geoffrey Huntley ran iterative loops over 3 months to build an entire programming language (Cursed)

**Key Technical Clarifications:**

1. **No Fixed Time Limit**: Ralph does not have a built-in time limit. Session duration is constrained by:
   - Iteration count (`--max-iterations` flag)
   - API costs (token consumption)
   - Task completion criteria
   - Hardware/sandbox stability

2. **Architecture Enables Extended Operation**: Ralph works through a persistent loop mechanism that resets AI context periodically to avoid token limits while preserving state through external files. This design explicitly enables long-running operations without accumulating excessive tokens.

3. **Iteration-Based, Not Time-Based**: The technique measures progress in iterations, not hours. A 50-iteration loop might take 30 minutes or 8 hours depending on task complexity.

### Why "Partially True"

The "8-12 hour" claim is:
- **Plausible**: Documented cases include sessions of 6 hours, 14 hours, and overnight runs
- **Not a Specification**: Ralph does not advertise a specific time window - it runs until tasks complete or iteration limits are reached
- **Context-Dependent**: Actual runtime depends on task complexity, API costs tolerance, and completion criteria

### Caveats

- Extended sessions require `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, bypassing safety controls
- Security experts recommend running in sandboxed environments (disposable VMs)
- Overnight/extended loops can incur significant API costs ($50-100+ for large operations)
- Success depends on well-defined completion criteria; ambiguous tasks may never converge
