**Symlinked to:** `~/.claude/skills/skll-create-persona.md`

## Research Findings

### Existing Structure
- The `~/.claude/skills/` directory was empty (no existing skills to reference)
- The directory is symlinked to `/Users/teazyou/sopai/dot-claude/skills/`
- Related directories (agents, commands, workflows) were also empty
- No existing format conventions to follow; established new pattern

### Skill Format Decision
- Used markdown format (`.md`) consistent with other Claude Code configuration files
- Created comprehensive instructional content since this is a teaching skill
- Included template, examples, and validation checklist

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. File Naming
- Used `skll-create-persona.md` as specified in the request
- Follows kebab-case convention consistent with persona naming guidance

### 2. Content Structure
Organized the skill into logical sections:
1. **Quick Start** - Overview of the process
2. **Understanding Personas** - Conceptual foundation
3. **Template** - Ready-to-use persona structure
4. **Step-by-Step Guide** - Detailed instructions for each section
5. **Include/Exclude Lists** - Clear boundaries
6. **Examples** - Good persona example and anti-pattern
7. **Validation Checklist** - Self-verification tool

### 3. Template Design
Included five core sections based on specification:
- Profile (expertise level, domain authority)
- Expertise Domains (hard skills)
- Communication Style (soft skills)
- Mindset (character traits, values)
- Focus Areas (priorities, trade-offs)

### 4. Teaching vs Prescribing
- The skill itself contains methodology and instructions (appropriate for a skill)
- Made clear distinction that the OUTPUT (personas) should NOT contain instructions
- Included explicit anti-pattern example showing what NOT to create

### 5. Validation Support
- Added checklist for users to verify their persona meets criteria
- Included "When to Use" section to prevent misuse

| Validate that output contains no procedural content | Validation checklist included; exclude list explicit |
| Generate properly formatted persona file | Template provided with markdown structure |
| Save to `~/.claude/agents/` with appropriate naming | Location and naming convention documented |
