# Skill Specification: skll-create-persona

## 1. Skill Purpose

This skill guides users through creating a **Persona** file for Claude Code. The Persona enhances model predictions by providing rich contextual vocabulary and character attributes associated with domain expertise, without prescribing methodologies or instructions.

---

## 2. Persona Definition

### What is a Persona?

A Persona is a character profile that influences how Claude predicts and generates responses. It shapes the *voice*, *perspective*, and *expertise depth* of outputs.

### Persona vs Agent

| Aspect | Persona | Agent |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Influence prediction patterns through character context | Execute tasks with specific instructions |
| **Content** | Character traits, expertise domains, mindset | Workflows, rules, methodologies |
| **Behavior** | Shapes *how* responses are framed | Defines *what* to do and *how* to do it |
| **Location** | `~/.claude/agents` | `~/.claude/agents` |

---

## 3. Core Philosophy

### Prediction Pattern Manipulation

Personas work by **seeding the model's context** with vocabulary, expertise markers, and character attributes that statistically correlate with high-quality domain-specific outputs.

**Key Principle**: A Persona does not teach or instruct. It *embodies* expertise so that predictions naturally align with expert-level discourse.

### Example Distinction

**Wrong (Instructional)**:
> "When reviewing code, always check for security vulnerabilities first, then optimize for performance..."

**Correct (Persona)**:
> "A seasoned security architect with 15 years experience in enterprise systems. Instinctively notices attack vectors. Thinks in threat models. Values defense-in-depth."

## 4. What a Persona INCLUDES

### 4.1 Profile Description
- Expertise level (years of experience, mastery tier)
- Domain authority (recognized expert, practitioner, specialist)
- Professional identity and background

### 4.2 Soft Skills
- Communication style (concise, verbose, socratic, direct)
- Thought patterns (analytical, creative, systematic, intuitive)
- Interaction tendencies (collaborative, mentoring, challenging)
- Decision-making approach (data-driven, intuition-based, consensus-seeking)

### 4.3 Hard Skills
- Technical domains and specializations
- Tools and technologies associated with expertise
- Knowledge areas and depth indicators

### 4.4 Focus Areas and Priorities
- What this persona naturally pays attention to
- Quality dimensions they prioritize
- Trade-offs they typically favor

### 4.5 Character Traits and Mindset
- Professional values and principles
- Cognitive biases and tendencies (healthy skepticism, optimism, pragmatism)
- Work ethic descriptors
- Curiosity areas and intellectual interests

---

## 5. What a Persona EXCLUDES

| Excluded Element | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| **How-to instructions** | Personas describe *who*, not *how* |
| **Methodologies or processes** | These belong in agents or skills |
| **Rules or guidelines** | Prescriptive content contradicts persona purpose |
| **Implementation details** | Technical steps are agent territory |
| **Checklists or procedures** | Operational content, not character content |
| **Conditional logic** | "If X then Y" belongs in workflows |

---

## 6. File Location

**Path**: `~/.claude/agents/[persona-name].md`

Personas share the same directory as agents. The content structure differentiates them, not the location.

**Naming Convention**: Use descriptive, kebab-case names
- `senior-backend-architect.md`
- `ux-research-lead.md`
- `security-specialist.md`

---

## 7. Use Cases

### When to Use a Persona

1. **Domain-specific work**: Need outputs reflecting deep expertise in a field
2. **Consistent voice**: Want a particular communication style across interactions
3. **Quality elevation**: Seek expert-level thinking without explicit methodology
4. **Role simulation**: Embodying a specific professional perspective

### When NOT to Use a Persona

1. **Task execution**: Use an agent instead
2. **Process enforcement**: Use skills or workflows
3. **Rule compliance**: Use guidelines in agent instructions

## 8. Examples

### Example Persona: Technical Lead

```markdown
# Technical Lead Persona

## Profile
A battle-tested technical lead with 12+ years building distributed systems at scale.
Led teams of 8-15 engineers across multiple successful product launches.

## Expertise Domains
- System architecture and design patterns
- Team technical mentorship
- Code quality and maintainability
- Performance optimization at scale

## Communication Style
Direct and precise. Explains complex concepts through practical analogies.
Asks probing questions before proposing solutions. Values clarity over cleverness.

## Mindset
- Pragmatic perfectionist: knows when "good enough" is right
- Thinks in trade-offs, not absolutes
- Protective of team velocity and developer experience
- Skeptical of hype, validated by production evidence

## Focus Areas
- Long-term maintainability over short-term speed
- Clear abstractions and boundaries
- Observable, debuggable systems
- Knowledge sharing and documentation
```

### Non-Persona Content (What to Avoid)

```markdown
# NOT a Persona - This is Agent Content

## Code Review Process
1. First check for security issues
2. Then review architecture decisions
3. Finally check code style

## Rules
- All PRs must have tests
- No direct commits to main
- Use conventional commits
```

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria for Skill

The `skll-create-persona` skill should:

1. Guide users to define character attributes, not instructions
2. Prompt for expertise domains, soft skills, and mindset
3. Validate that output contains no procedural content
4. Generate properly formatted persona file
5. Save to `~/.claude/agents/` with appropriate naming

---

## Summary

A Persona is a **character profile** that influences predictions through expertise context. It describes *who* the expert is, not *what* they do or *how* they do it. This distinction is critical: Personas shape output quality through statistical correlation with expert vocabulary, not through explicit instruction.
