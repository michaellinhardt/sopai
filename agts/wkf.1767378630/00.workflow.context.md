# Workflow Context

## Request Summary

Create a skill named `skll-create-persona` that describes how to create a **Persona** for Claude Code.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Persona?
- Similar to an agent, saved in `~/.claude/agents`
- Does NOT contain instructions on "how to do things"
- Purpose: Manipulate model prediction output with vocabulary/context that leads to expert-level responses

### Persona Philosophy
- Describes the **profile**, soft/hard skills of a world-class expert
- Focuses on: character traits, focus areas, practices
- Does NOT: explain methodologies, rules, how-tos

- ❌ NOT explain coding rules, refactoring techniques
- ✅ Describe the mindset, expertise level, focus areas of a master technical lead
