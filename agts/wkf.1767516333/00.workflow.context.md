# Workflow Context

## Initial Request
Restructure `skll-file-guide` skill following new structure defined in `request.structure.md`.

## Purpose
Re-write the skill file to follow a new delivery format for LLM consumption.

## Method
1. Task 1: AI Engineer agent restructures the skill based on new structure
2. Task 2: AI Engineer agent reviews changes for fidelity

## Acceptance Criteria
- Skill follows new structure exactly
- No additions beyond what structure specifies
- Output files renamed: `guide.files.md` and `list.files.md`

---

## Execution Report

### Tasks Accomplished
1. Restructured `skll-file-guide` skill following new structure
2. Reviewed changes for fidelity to specification

### AGT Files
- `00.workflow.context.md` - workflow state and execution report

### Project Files Edited
- `/Users/teazyou/sopai/dot-claude/skills/skll-file-guide/SKILL.md` - restructured per new format

### Agents/Personas/Skills Used
- `agt-ai-engineer` - restructuring task
- `agt-ai-engineer` - review task

### Review Findings
**Issue Found:** Minor filename inconsistency
- Reference spec uses: `guide.file.md` (singular)
- Implementation uses: `guide.files.md` (plural)

The plural form is arguably more consistent with `list.files.md`. Clarification needed from user.
