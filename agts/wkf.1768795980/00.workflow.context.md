- Smooth change management through planning to code
- Similar workflow to BMAD: brainstorm → document → implement

## Research Per Framework
1. Pricing (free tier, paid tiers, API costs, hidden costs)
2. Brainstorming support (idea exploration, technical discussions)
3. Document generation (PRDs, architecture, user stories)
4. Change propagation (updates flow through docs to code)
5. Development control (AI implements, user directs)
6. End-to-end workflow support

## Frameworks to Research
- GitHub Spec Kit
- MetaGPT
- AutoGPT
