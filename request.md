# Request

Task Opus sub-agent to use `skll-create-skill` to turn an agent into a skill.

the agent is located at `/Users/teazyou/workspace/claude-code/claude-agents/agt-seq-prompt-compressor.md`

Beware! the agent is used to compress file (prompt). it receive a path and compress it. I want the skill to work the same but it can also directly receive the content to compress in its input and write a new compressed file from the content he received. so it compress either existing file or a given string content.

Most importantly, the compression process of this agent work VERY WELL. You keep it EXACTLY AS IT IS DESCRIBED, same structure, same content, words etc.. because the performance are currently very good, dont change anything.

name skill: `skll-prompt-compression`
