# Folder ./docs

In this folder, documentation is "feature-based"

One folder for each features.

A feature folder can contain functional requirements, task list, technical requirements, etc.. which is centered on this feature only.

Every file in ./docs, which are not in a folder, are related to a higher scope than feature.
